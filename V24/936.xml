  <discussion>Polypogon fugax is native from Iraq to Myanmar [Burma]. It was collected in Santa Barbara, California, and from salt marshes around Oakland, California, in the nineteenth century, and from Portland, Oregon, in the early twentieth century. There are no recent collections from the Flora region.</discussion>
