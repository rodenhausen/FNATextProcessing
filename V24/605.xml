  <description type="morphology">Plants densely cespitose, without rhizomes. Culms (3)10-15 (18) cm, more than twice as tall as the vegetative shoot leaves, erect, glabrous, sometimes slightly scabrous below the inflorescences. Sheaths closed for about 1/2 their length, glabrous, persistent; collars glabrous; ligules 0.3-0.5 mm; blades (0.3)0.4-0.8(1) mm in diameter, conduplicate, abaxial surfaces glabrous, adaxial surfaces scabrous or pubescent, veins 5-7(9), ribs (3)5(7); abaxial sclerenchyma in 5-7 strands, usually less than twice as wide as high; adaxial sclerenchyma absent; flag leaf sheaths often somewhat inflated; flag leaf blades 0.2-1 cm. Inflorescences (0.7)1-5 cm, usually racemes; branches erect, lower branches with 1(2) spikelets. Spikelets (4)5-7(8) mm, with 2-4(5) florets. Glumes exceeded by the upper florets, ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate; lower glumes (1.2)2.5-3.2 mm; upper glumes (2.4)3.2-4.8 mm; lemmas (3)4-5.5(7) mm, ovate-lanceolate to lanceolate, glabrous, scabrous distally, awns (0.2)0.5-2.5 mm, terminal; paleas about as long as the lemmas, intercostal region smooth or scabrous distally; anthers (0.6)0.9-1.2 mm; ovary apices glabrous. 2n = 14.</description>
