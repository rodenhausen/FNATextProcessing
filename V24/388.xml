  <discussion>Triticum timopheevii is the domesticated derivative of T. araraticum Jakubz. It is established in Georgia, Armenia, and northeastern Turkey. It differs from other species of Triticum in its long leaf hairs and their relatively higher density. Plants with tough rachises and chartaceous glumes have been named T. militinae Zhuk. & Migush.</discussion>
