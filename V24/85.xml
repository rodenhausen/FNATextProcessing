  <discussion>Glyceria melicaria grows in swamps and wet soils. Its range extends from southeastern Ontario east to Nova Scotia, south to Illinois and the northeastern United States and, in the Appalachian Mountains, to northern Georgia. Glyceria xgatineauensis Bowden is a sterile hybrid between G. melicaria and G. striata. For further comments, see p. 77.</discussion>
