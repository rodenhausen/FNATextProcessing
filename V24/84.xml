  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial. Culms 60-100 cm tall, 2.5-5 mm thick, often decumbent at the base. Sheaths glabrous, smooth, not keeled, midvein prominent; ligules 0.5-0.8 mm, not translucent, truncate to slightly rounded; blades 15-40 cm long, 2-8 mm wide, abaxial surfaces smooth, adaxial surfaces scabridulous. Panicles 5-15 cm long, 2.5-6 cm wide, ovoid, erect, dense; branches 2.5- 8 cm, strongly ascending, with 10-30 spikelets; pedicels 1-14 mm. Spikelets 4-7 mm long, 2.5-4 mm wide, somewhat laterally compressed, oval in side view, with 4-7 florets. Glumes keeled, 1-veined, veins not extending to the apical margins, apical margins hyaline, acute, entire or often splitting with age; lower glumes 1.6-2.5 mm, lanceolate to narrowly ovate or obovate; upper glumes 1.7-3.5 mm, ovate-elliptic to obovate, obtuse to rounded; rachilla internodes 0.2-0.4 mm; lemmas 3-3.9 mm, 5-9-veined, veins not raised, apices rounded, somewhat prow-shaped; paleas subequal to the lemmas, lengths 2-2.8 times widths, keels well-developed, not winged, tips pointing towards each other, narrowly notched between the keels; anthers 2, 0.6-0.8 mm.
