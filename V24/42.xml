  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; rhizomatous, rhizomes moderately elongate, scaly. Culms 50-150 cm tall, 1-3 mm thick, usually ascending, unbranched or branched; nodes retrorsely hispidulous, adjacent portion of the internodes glabrous. Sheaths glabrous or scabrous; ligules 0.5-1.5 mm; blades 4-35 cm long, 5-22 mm wide, spreading to somewhat ascending, abaxial surfaces glabrous or scabridulous, adaxial surfaces glabrous or pubescent, margins usually scabrous. Panicles 4-25 cm, exserted, with 1(2) branches per node; branches 8-15 cm, spreading, secund, lower branches naked on the lower 73, spikelets strongly imbricate. Spikelets 4-5.5 mm long, 3-4 mm wide, broadly elliptic to suborbicular. Lemmas coarsely ciliate on the keels, variously pubescent on the margins and body, mucronate; paleas ciliate on the keels; anthers 2. Caryopses 3.5-4 mm, reddish-brown. 2n = 48.</description>
