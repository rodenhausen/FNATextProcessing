  <discussion>Dissanthelium californicum is known only from Santa Catalina and San Clemente islands, California, and Guadalupe Island, Baja California, Mexico. It grows in coastal sage-scrub. Until its rediscovery on Santa Catalina Island in 2005, it was thought to be extinct in California, not having been reported from the state since 1903.</discussion>
