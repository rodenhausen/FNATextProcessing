  <description type="morphology">Plants rarely with sterile culms. Culms (10)35-90(100) cm, usually smooth, sometimes slightly scabrous beneath the panicles. Sheaths and collars smooth; ligules (0.5)1-3.5(4) mm; blades (9)13-25 cm long, (1)1.5-2.5(3) mm wide, flat or often involute. Panicles (2)8-10(13) cm long, (0.7)1-2(2.5) cm wide, sometimes interrupted, purple-tinged; branches (1.4)2-2.5(4) cm, spikelet-bearing to below midlength, sometimes to the base. Spikelets 2-2.5(3) mm; rachilla prolongations 0.5-1 mm. Glumes keeled; callus hairs (1)1.5-2(3) mm, (0.5)0.7-0.8(1) times as long as the lemmas; lemmas 2-3 mm, 0.1-1.5 mm shorter than the glumes; awns 1.5-2.5 mm, attached to the lower 1/10-1/2 of the lemmas, rarely slender, usually straight, sometimes bent; anthers (1.1)1.2-1.4(1.7) mm, usually fertile and well filled with pollen, dehiscent. 2n = 28, 42, 56, +70.</description>
  <discussion>A circumboreal taxon, Calamagrostis stricta subsp. stricta favors moist meadows and fens, occurring less frequently in marshes and bogs, and sometimes grows near sand dunes. It is usually associated with fine-textured  substrates.  In the Flora region,  its  range extends from Alaska to Newfoundland and Labrador and Greenland, and south to California, Utah, North Dakota, Minnesota, New Hampshire, and New York.
 
In Europe, it extends from 50Â° N latitude to Switzerland and the southern Caucasus.</discussion>
