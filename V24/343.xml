Central spikelets: glumes 8-17 mm long, 0.5-1.5 mm wide, distinctly flattened near the base; lemmas 5-8.5 mm, usually glabrous, sometimes sparsely to densely pubescent, awned, awns 3.5-9.5 mm; anthers 0.7-1.8 mm. Lateral spikelets usually sterile; glumes to 18 mm; lower glumes distinctly flattened, more or less winged basally; lemmas 2.5-5.7 mm, usually awned, awns to 1.8 mm, rarely unawned; anthers 0.6-1.2 mm. 2n = 14.</description>
  <discussion>Hordeum pusillum grows in open grasslands, pastures, and the borders of marshes, and in disturbed places such as roadsides and waste places, often in alkaline soil. It is native, widespread, and often common in much of the Flora region. Its range extends into northern Mexico, but it is not common there.</discussion>
