  <discussion>Eremopoa altaica is native to the high deserts and mountain steppes of Asia, from Turkey through Afghanistan and Pakistan to the Altai region, the Himalayas, and western China. It was once found in railway yards and roadsides at Brandon, Manitoba (Stevenson 1965), but misidentified as Eremopoa persica (Trin.) Roshev. Although the population persisted for several years, recent efforts to relocate it haved failed.  </discussion>
