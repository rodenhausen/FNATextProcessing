  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial, rarely annual. Sheaths compressed, usually at least weakly keeled. Inflorescences 0.5-5 cm wide if the branches appressed, to 20 cm wide if divergent; branches usually appressed to ascending, divergent at anthesis; pedicels 0.5-5 mm. Spikelets cylindrical and terete, except at anthesis when slightly laterally compressed, rectangular in side view, appressed to the panicle branches, lengths 5-22 times widths. Lemmas rounded over the back, apices acute to rounded or truncate, entire to irregularly lobed; paleas keeled, keels usually winged distally, tips parallel or almost so, sometimes extending into teeth, truncate, rounded, or notched between the keels; lodicules connate; anthers 3. Caryopses ovoid-oblong; hila about as long as the caryopses, linear.</description>
