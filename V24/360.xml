  <discussion>Hordeum bulbosum is native to the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia. In the Flora region, it is known as an occasional escape from breeding programs. In its native range it is found in a wide range of habitats, from wet meadows to dry hillsides, roadsides, and abandoned fields. It is one of two obligate outcrossers in the genus, H. brevisubulatum (Trin.) Link being the other.</discussion>
