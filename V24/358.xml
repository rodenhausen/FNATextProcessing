  <discussion>Hordeum murinum subsp. leporinum grows in waste places, roadsides, and disturbed areas in arid regions. It is native to the Mediterranean region. It is now established in the Flora region, being most common in the western United States. A hexaploid cytotype has been found in Turkey, Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Iran. It has been named H. leporinum var. simulans Bowden. It is treated here as part of H. murinum subsp. leporinum.</discussion>
