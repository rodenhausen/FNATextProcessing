  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; stoloniferous, often forming extensive low mats. Culms 2-15 cm, erect or decumbent. Ligules 0.4-1.5 mm, acute, obtuse, or truncate, entire; blades 0.4-2.2 mm wide when flat, 0.2-1 mm in diameter when involute. Panicles usually not developed, if developed, 1-7 cm, diffuse, lower branches ascending, spikelets usually confined to the distal 1/3; pedicels scabrous, usually with tumid epidermal cells. Spikelets 6-9 mm, with 3-6(7) florets. Glumes rounded or slightly keeled over the back, veins obscure or distinct, apices acute or obtuse; lower glumes 1.5-2.2 mm; upper glumes 2.3-2.8 mm; calluses glabrous or almost so; lemmas 3.2-3.8(4.5) mm, membranous, usually glabrous, occasionally sparsely hairy, backs rounded, 5-veined, veins obscure, not extending to the margins, apices acute or rounded, apical margins whitish, hyaline, smooth, entire; palea veins glabrous; anthers (1.5)2-2.5 mm, aimost always indehiscent, mature pollen rarely produced.
