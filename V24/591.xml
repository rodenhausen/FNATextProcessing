  <description type="morphology">Plants rhizomatous, usually loosely cespitose, with several culms arising from the same tuft. Culms (20)30-70(80) cm. Sheaths glabrous or pubescent, sometimes glaucous, shredding into fibers, cauline sheaths usually wide, loosely enclosing the culms; vegetative shoot blades 0.7-1.5 mm in diameter, conduplicate, sometimes glaucous, abaxial surfaces more or less evenly scabrous, adaxial surfaces pilose on the ribs; cauline blades sometimes to 2.5 mm wide, sometimes flat; abaxial sclerenchyma in small strands; abaxial sclerenchyma rarely present. Inflorescences 7.5-12 cm, more or less open, usually secund, often partially included in the uppermost leaf sheaths at maturity; branches lax, scabrous. Spikelets 9.5-13 mm, green to violet, sometimes glaucous, with 4-7 florets. Lower glumes 3.1-4.5 mm; upper glumes (4.5)5-5.6 mm; lemmas 5.8-6.6 mm, attenuate in side view, mostly green, sometimes with violet borders, glabrous or more or less uniformly hairy, margins and apices scabrous, apices awned, awns 1-5 mm; anthers 2.8-3.9 mm. 2n = 42.</description>
