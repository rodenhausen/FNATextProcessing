  <discussion>Gaudinia fragilis is the most widespread species of the genus in the Mediterranean region. The first record of its presence in the United States dates from a collection made by Karl Zimmer on ballast ground in Mobile, Alabama, in 1885. In 1991, it was discovered in Sonoma County, California, where it was found growing on an open, grassy hilltop in the thin, rocky soil of open oak woodlands, in a region that has long been used for agriculture.
