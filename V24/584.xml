  <description type="morphology">Plants strongly rhizomatous, usually loosely cespitose, with several culms arising from the same tuft. Culms  
(10)30-60 cm.

Inflorescences (5.5)7-15(16) cm, open, lanceolate, usually completely exserted from the uppermost leaf sheaths; branches scabrous. Spikelets (7)9-10(13) mm, with (4)6-8(9) florets. Glumes ovate-lanceolate, acute; lower glumes 3-6(6.5) mm; upper glumes (3.5)4-6.5(8.5) mm; lemmas 6-8(9.5) mm, lanceolate, green, sometimes glaucous, glabrous or villous, apices acute to acuminate, awned, awns (0.5)1-2(3) mm; anthers 2.6-4.5 mm. 2n = 56.

  <discussion>Festuca rubra subsp. arenaria is a European taxon that grows in maritime sands and gravels. It is known in the Flora region only from one specimen collected on Vancouver Island; it is not known to have persisted. The description is based on the range of variation seen in Europe. In the Flora region, the name has long been misapplied to F. richardsonii Hook. [= F. rubra subsp. arctica], which also has hairy lemmas.</discussion>
