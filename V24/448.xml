  </taxon_identification>
  <common_names>CALIFORNIA SQUIRRELTAIL</common_names>
  <description type="morphology">Culms 8-40 cm, erect or decumbent. Blades usually glabrous abaxially, sometimes puberulent. Spikes 3-10 cm, often partly included, usually with 2 spikelets per node. Spikelets with (1)2-3 fertile florets, lowest 1-2 florets sterile and glumelike. Glume awns 15-40(70) mm, entire; lemma awns 25-70 mm, usually exceeding those of the glumes; paleas often with the veins extended as 1-2 mm bristles.</description>
  <discussion>Elymus elymoides subsp. californicus grows in mid-montane to arctic-alpine habitats in western North America, at elevations of 1500-4200 m. Plants transitional to subsp. elymoides occur where the two are sympatric.</discussion>
