  <discussion>Cinna arundinacea grows in southeastern Canada and throughout most of the eastern United States, at 0-900 m. It is most common in moist woodlands and swamps, depressions, along streams, and in floodplains and upland woods. It is less frequent in wet meadows, marshes, and disturbed sites. It flowers in late summer to fall. Cinna arundinacea is most easily distinguished from C. latifolia by its 3-veined upper glumes and larger spikelets.</discussion>
