  <description type="morphology">Plants stoloniferous, fully or mostly emergent. Culms 10-40 cm, suberect, branching, fully or mostly emergent. Leaves mostly basal or scattered along the culms, not conspicuously floating or streaming in the current; sheaths glabrous or ciliate; ligules to 5 mm, lanceolate, acuminate; blades 3-30 cm long, 0.5-4 mm wide, glabrous, sometimes scabridulous. Inflorescences panicles. Staminate panicles 1-3 cm, terminal, with 10-25 spikelets; staminate florets 3.5-8 mm, caducous; lemmas lanceolate, 5-veined; paleas similar, 3-veined; anthers 6, 2-5 mm. Pistillate panicles to 7 cm, arising from the lower to middle nodes of the culms, partially exserted from the sheaths, with 10-25 spikelets; branches filiform, spreading to reflexed; pistillate florets 2-2.5 mm, caducous; lemmas 7-14-veined, erose to acuminate or caudate; paleas similar to the lemmas, 5-10-veined; stigmas 2-3 mm. Achenes 1-1.3 mm, broadly ellipsoid to subglobose, smooth, lustrous. 2n = 24.</description>
