  <description type="morphology">Plants loosely cespitose, without rhizomes. Culms 50-100 cm, glabrous, somewhat glaucous; nodes usually exposed. Sheaths closed for less than 1/3 their length, glabrous or sparsely pubescent, shredding into fibers; ligules 0.5-1 mm; blades 2-10 mm wide, flat, loosely conduplicate, or involute, abaxial surfaces smooth or scabrous, glabrous or puberulent, adaxial surfaces smooth or scabrous, veins 13-35, ribs obscure; sclerenchyma in abaxial and adaxial strands; girders formed at most major veins. Inflorescences (8)10-30(40) cm, open, with 1-2 branches per node; branches lax, spreading, spikelets borne towards the ends of branches. Spikelets 6-11 mm, sometimes glaucous, with (2)3-5 florets. Glumes lanceolate, smooth or scabrous, acuminate; lower glumes 4-7 mm; upper glumes 5-7.5 mm; lemmas 5-8 mm, chartaceous, lanceolate, glabrous, usually smooth, sometimes scabrous towards the apices, apices acute to acuminate, unawned, sometimes mucronate; paleas as long as or slightly shorter than the lemmas, intercostal region puberulent distally; anthers 2-3 mm; ovary apices densely pubescent. 2n = unknown.</description>
