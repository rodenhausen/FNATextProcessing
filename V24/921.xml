Leaves mostly cauline or somewhat basally concentrated; sheaths smooth; ligules 2.3-7 mm, dorsal surfaces scabrous, apices acute, usually lacerate; blades 6-20 cm long, 2-5 mm wide, flat. Panicles 7-22 cm long, 1.5-5.5(7) cm wide, lanceolate to narrowly ovate, more or less open to dense, lowest node with 2-15 branches; branches scabridulous, ascending to more or less appressed, mostly branching at or above midlength, some branching near the base, lower branches 1-5 cm; pedicels 0.5-6 mm. Spikelets lanceolate, yellow-green, often tinged with purple.
