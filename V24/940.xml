  <discussion>Polypogon imberbis is a South American species that has been collected at two locations in California, one from Oceano Beach, San Luis Obispo County, and the other near Martines, Contra Costa County. It does not appear to be established there, the last collections having been made before 1950. In South America, it grows in moist, sandy soils near streams, lagoons, and the coast.
