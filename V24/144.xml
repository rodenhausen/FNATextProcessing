  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; tightly to loosely cespitose, sometimes shortly rhizomatous. Culms 10-250 cm, erect, not branching at the upper nodes; basal branching extra- or intravaginal; prophylls shorter than the sheaths. Leaves sometimes concentrated at the base; sheaths open, margins often ciliate distally; cleistogenes not present in the basal leaf sheaths; collars sometimes with hairs on the sides; auricles absent; ligules hyaline to membranous, glabrous or pubescent, sometimes ciliate; blades flat, convolute, or involute, apices acute, flexible, basal blades not overwintering, flag leaf blades more than 10 mm long. Inflorescences terminal panicles, usually contracted, sometimes 2 forming at the terminal node; branches usually straight, sometimes flexuous. Spikelets usually appressed to the branches, with 1 floret; rachillas not prolonged beyond the floret; disarticulation above the glumes, beneath the floret. Glumes exceeding the floret, usually lanceolate, 1-7-veined, acute to acuminate, sometimes obtuse; florets usually terete, fusiform or globose, sometimes somewhat laterally compressed; calluses 0.1-4 mm, blunt to sharp, usually strigose; lemmas stiffly membranous to coriaceous, smooth, usually hairy, sometimes glabrous, hairs on the lemma body to 6 mm, usually evenly distributed, hairs on the upper 74 sometimes somewhat longer than those below, not both markedly longer and more divergent, apical hairs to 7 mm, lemma margins usually not or only weakly overlapping, firmly overlapping in some species with glabrous lemmas, usually terminating in 0.05-3 mm lobes, sometimes unlobed, lobes usually membranous and flexible, sometimes thick, apices with a single, terminal, centric awn, awn-lemma junction evident; awns 3-80 mm, centric, readily deciduous to persistent, usually scabrous to scabridulous, sometimes hairy in whole or in part, if shorter than 12 mm, usually deciduous, not or once-geniculate and scarcely twisted, if longer than 12 mm, usually persistent, once- or twice-geniculate and twisted below, terminal segment usually straight, sometimes flexuous; paleas from 1/3 as long as to slightly longer than the lemmas, usually pubescent, 2-veined, not keeled over the veins, flat between the veins, veins usually terminating below the apices, sometimes prolonged 1-3 mm, apices usually rounded; lodicules 2 or 3, membranous, not lobed; anthers 3, 1.5-6 mm, sometimes penicillate; ovaries with 2 style branches, branches fused at the base.

  <discussion>As interpreted here, Achnatherum is one of the larger and more widely distributed genera in the Stipeae. It is difficult to estimate how many species it contains because its boundaries are still unclear. Of the 28 species in the Flora region, only A. splendens, from Europe, is introduced.
Most species of Achnatherum used to be included in Stipa, a genus that at one time included almost all Stipeae with an elongated floret. Keng (cited in Tsvelev 1977) transferred some Chinese species of Stipa sensu lato with blunt calluses and less indurate lemmas than Stipa sensu stricto to Achnatherum, a realignment that Tsvelev (1977) supported. Thomasson (1978) demonstrated that several North and South American species of Stipa had lemma epidermes similar to those of the Eurasian species of Stipa that had been transferred to Achnatherum. After considering various additional characters (Barkworth 1981, 1982), Barkworth (1993) transferred most North American species of Stipa and some of Oryzopsis into the expanded Achnatherum. In retrospect, her transfer of South American species to Achnatherum was
 
ill-advised. Some have since been transferred to Amelichloa (Arriaga and Barkworth 2006), others to Jarava (Peiiailillo 2002). With its current boundaries, Achnatherum is probably still polyphyletic (Jacobs et al. 2006), but the evidence does not support return of the North American species treated as Achnatherum to either Stipa or Oryzopsis.
In the key, glume widths are the distance between the midvein and the margin. Floret lengths include the callus, but not the apical lobes. Floret thickness refers to the thickest part of the floret.
