  <discussion>Cinna bolanderi is endemic to meadows and streamsides at 1900-2400 m in Sequoia, Kings Canyon, and Yosemite national parks. It flowers from late summer to fall. It used to be included in C. latifolia, but it differs from that species in having 2 anthers, longer anthers and spikelets, and sessile florets. The two species do not overlap in distribution.</discussion>
