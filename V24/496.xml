  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Plants rhizomatous. Culms to 75 cm tall, mostly glabrous, hairy for about 1 cm below the spikes, hairs about 0.1 mm. Blades to 15 mm wide, adaxial surfaces with the primary and secondary veins evident, subequal. Inflorescences spikes, to 15 cm long, 20 mm wide, erect, with (1)2 subsessile spikelets per node, pedicels to 1 mm; internodes about 5 mm. Spikelets with 3-5 florets; disarticulation above the glumes, beneath the florets. Glumes 10.5-13 mm long, 1.3-2(2.3) mm wide, linear-lanceolate to linear, flexible, hairy, 3-4(5)-veined, veins prominent, apices unawned or awned, awns to 1.2 mm; lemmas 15-18 mm, lemmas awned, awns 1-7 mm, more or less straight; anthers 2.3-3.9 mm.</description>
  <discussion>xElyleums aleuticus comprises hybrids between Elytnus hirsutus and Leymus mollis. It is known only from the type locality, Atka, Alaska. It probably occurs at other locations where the two parents are sympatric.</discussion>
