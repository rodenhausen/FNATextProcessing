  <description type="morphology">Culms (2)3.5-15 cm. Leaves cauline or mostly basal; sheaths glabrous; ligules 0.3-1(1.6) mm, entire, acute; blades 0.6-2.8 cm long, 1.2-3 mm wide, glabrous. Panicles (0.5) 1-2(3) cm long, 3-7 mm wide, dense or slightly diffuse; rachises smooth; primary branches (0.9)3-8(9.5) mm, smooth, usually appressed, sometimes spreading, particularly at anthesis; secondary branches appressed.

  <discussion>Phippsia algida is a circumpolar species that also grows at high elevations in the Rocky Mountains and the Andes. It is one of the first grasses to flower in the high arctic, which may contribute to its success as an early colonizer of disturbed areas. Although highly nitrophilous, it can tolerate a wide range of soils, from highly alkaline to peat and imperfectly drained mud flats. It sometimes hybridizes with Puccinellia vahliana. Plants of P. algida with slightly hairy lemmas have been recognized as P. algida f. vestita Holmb.
The original circumscription of Phippsia algida subsp. algidiformis (Harry Sm.) Á. Löve & D. Love is unclear (Steen et al. 2004). Harry (K.A.H.) Smith subsequently included his specimens in P. concinna, indicating that he no longer recognized the taxon he had described. Some of his specimens, and those of Bay (1992) collected in Greenland, that are deposited at C and O have been reidentified as P. algida or P. concinna (some as depauperate P. concinna) by Reidar Elven (University of Oslo).</discussion>
