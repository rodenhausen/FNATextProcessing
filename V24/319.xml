Panicles 3-15 cm long, 2-6 cm wide, open, erect; branches (at least some) 1-3+ cm, ascending to spreading, never drooping, usually visible, with 1 or 2 spikelets. Spikelets 30-50 mm, longer than the panicle branches, not densely crowded, with parallel sides or widening distally, moderately laterally compressed, with 6-10 florets. Glumes pilose, margins hyaline; lower glumes 5-10 mm, 1-veined; upper glumes 10-15 mm, 3-veined; lemmas 12-20 mm, linear-lanceolate, often arcuate, pubescent, with longer hairs near the margins, 5-7-veined, rounded over the midvein, margins hyaline, apices acuminate, teeth 1.5-3 mm; awns 12-23 mm, straight or arcuate, arising 1.5 mm or more below the lemma apices; anthers 0.5-1 mm. 2n = 28.</description>
