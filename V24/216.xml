  <description type="morphology">Culms 12-110 cm; lower nodes glabrous or pubescent. Lower sheaths glabrous or pubescent, not ciliate; ligules of lower leaves 1-6.5 mm, scarious, usually acute, sometimes trunÂ¬cate, often lacerate; ligules of upper leaves to 7 mm; blades 0.5-4 mm wide, usually involute. Panicles 10-32 cm, contracted. Glumes 16-35 mm, 3-5-veined; lower glumes 18-35 mm; upper glumes 1-3 mm shorter; florets 7-13 mm; calluses 2-4 mm; lemmas evenly pubescent, hairs about 1 mm, white, sometimes glabrous immediately above the callus; awns 65-225 mm, first 2 segments scabrous to strigose, hairs shorter than 1 mm, terminal segment scabridulous.</description>
  <discussion>Hesperostipa comata is found primarily in the cool deserts, grasslands, and pinyon-juniper forests of western North America. The two subspecies overlap geographically, but are only occasionally sympatric. Both are primarily cleistogamous.</discussion>

1. Terminal awn segment 40-120 mm long, sinuous to curled at maturity; lower cauline nodes usually concealed by the sheaths; panicles often partially enclosed in the uppermost sheath at maturity  .....subsp. comata
1. Terminal awn segment 30-80 mm long, straight; lower cauline nodes usually exposed; panicles usually completely exserted at maturity.....subsp. intermedia
