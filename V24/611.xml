  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Culms (5)8-20(25) cm, usually 2-3 times the height of the vegetative shoot leaves, usually glabrous below the inflorescence. Outer vegetative shoot sheaths mostly stramineous; blades smooth or scabrous on the abaxial surfaces, ribs on the adaxial surfaces with hairs shorter than 0.06 mm; abaxial sclerenchyma in 5-7 narrow abaxial strands. Lemmas usually scabrous towards the apices and often along the margins.</description>
  <discussion>Festuca saximontana var. purpusiana grows in subalpine or lower alpine habitats. The distribution of this taxon is poorly known; it probably extends from Alaska south to northern California. It is also reported from the Chukchi Peninsula in eastern Russia (Tzvelev 1976).</discussion>
