  <discussion>Piptochaetium setosum is native to central Chile. There is an established population in Marin County, California, that grows intermingled with P. stipoides, another South American species. The two species grow in the middle of a dirt track and in the adjacent meadow.  The California plants of P. setosum are  
notable for their prostrate culms. This characteristic was not mentioned by Parodi (1944) or Cialdella and Arriaga (1998).
The origin of the California population is not known. It has been suggested that the seeds might have been brought in by birds, as the area was a bird refuge at one time.</discussion>
