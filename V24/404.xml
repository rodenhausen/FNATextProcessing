  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; usually cespitose, occasionally shortly rhizomatous. Inflorescences terminal, spikes or spikelike, with 1-3(7) spikelets per node, lateral spikelets usually shortly pedicellate, central spikelets sessile or nearly so; disarticulation tardy, at the rachis nodes and beneath the florets. Spikelets with 1-4 florets. Glumes subulate to narrowly lanceolate, usually awned; lemmas usually awned; anthers sterile. Caryopses rarely formed.</description>
