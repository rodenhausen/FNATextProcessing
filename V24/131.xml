  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; loosely cespitose. Culms 30-110 cm, glabrous, often decumbent at the base; nodes glabrous, becoming dark. Sheaths closed almost to the top; ligules membranous, margins often united in front; blades folded or loosely involute, glabrous or pilose. Inflorescences panicles or racemes, with 4-20 spikelets; branches straight and appressed to lax and drooping. Spikelets slightly laterally compressed, with 3-6 florets; disarticulation above the glumes and beneath the florets. Glumes exceeded by the lowest lemma in each spikelet, chartaceous, often anthocyanic below, the upper 1/3 hyaline; calluses rounded, with hairs; lemmas chartaceous, slightly scabrous, 7-9-veined, veins parallel, conspicuous, apices scarious, bifid, awned from below the teeth, awns 8-15 mm, divergent or slightly geniculate; paleas shorter than the lemmas, 2-veined, veins ciliate, keeled; lodicules truncate; anthers 3; ovaries glabrous. Caryopses 3.2-3.8 mm, smooth, shiny, falling free of the lemma and palea. x = 10. </description>
