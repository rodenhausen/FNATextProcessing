  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; sometimes rhizomatous. Culms 50-80 cm, erect, glabrous. Leaves not basally concentrated; sheaths glabrous or puberulent; auricles present; ligules truncate. Inflorescences distichous spikes, with 1(2) spikelet(s) per node. Spikelets appressed, with 3-5 florets. Glumes unequal, linear-lanceolate to lanceolate; lemmas awned or unawned; paleas slightly shorter than to slightly longer than the lemmas; anthers indehiscent.</description>
  <discussion>xPseudelymus comprises hybrids between Pseudoroegneria and Elymus. Only one species is treated here. Another species, E. albicans, is thought to be a similar hybrid, but it is treated as a species because it is frequently fertile.</discussion>
