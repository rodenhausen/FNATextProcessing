  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Culms 60-100 cm. Sheaths glabrous; blades 5-8 mm wide, flat, lax. Inflorescences spikelike, 8-17 cm, nodding, with 3 spikelets per node. Spikelets with 1-4 florets, the lateral spikelets usually shortly pedicellate, with 1(2) sterile florets, the central spikelet sessile, with 2(3-4) sterile florets, the third and fourth florets rudimentary. Glumes 10-35 mm including the awns, slightly widened above the base; lowest lemma of central florets about 8 mm, glabrous towards the base, sparsely scabrous distally, awned, awns 15-25 mm, straight to slightly divergent at maturity. 2n = 28.</description>
  <discussion>xElyhordeum montanense applies to hybrids between Elymus virginicus and Hordeum jubatum. It is often found in disturbed areas where both parental taxa grow. Short-awned specimens may reflect the involvement of E. submuticus rather than E. virginicus, two taxa that have sometimes been treated as conspecific.</discussion>
