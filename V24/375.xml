  <description type="morphology">Plants annual. Culms 14-80 cm, usually glabrous, erect or geniculate at the base, with (1)2-4(5) nodes. Sheaths open; auricles ciliate; ligules 0.2-0.8 mm, membranous, truncate; blades 1.5-10 mm wide, linear to linear-lanceolate, flat, spreading. Inflorescences terminal spikes, with 2-13 spikelets, usually with 1-3 additional rudimentary spikelets at the base; internodes 6-12 mm; disarticulation either at the base of the spikes or in the rachises, the spikelets falling attached to the internodes above or below. Spikelets solitary at each node, 72-2(3) times the length of the internodes, tangential to the rachis, appressed or ascending, the upper spikelet(s) sometimes sterile; fertile spikelets 5-15 mm, with 2-7 florets, the distal florets often sterile. Glumes ovate to rectangular, rounded on the back, scabrous or pubescent, with several prominent veins, midveins smooth throughout, apices truncate, toothed, or awned, sometimes indurate at maturity; lemmas rounded on the back, apices toothed, frequently awned; paleas chartaceous, 2-keeled, keels ciliate; anthers 3, 1.5-4 mm, not penicillate; ovaries with pubescent apices. Caryopses lanceolate to lanceolate-ovate, x = 7. Haplomes B, C, D, S, T, U, M, N. </description>
  <discussion>Aegilops has about 23 species, and is native to the Canary Islands, as well as from the Mediterranean region to central Asia. It is sometimes included in Triticum because the two form natural hybrids and both are involved in the evolution of the cultivated wheats, including T. aestivum. They are treated as distinct genera here, in keeping both with past practice and with their differing ecological attributes, Aegilops being a weedy genus.
Four species are established in the Flora region; only Aegilops cylindrica is widespread. The introductions occurred at the end of the nineteenth or beginning of the twentieth century. Three other species have been collected in the region; they are not known to have persisted.
In the key and descriptions, spike and spikelet lengths exclude the rudimentary spikelets and awns.
