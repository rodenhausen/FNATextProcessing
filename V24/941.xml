  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; loosely cespitose to spreading, rhizomatous. Culms 8-60 cm, usually branched below, ascending from a decumbent base or the lower nodes geniculate. Sheaths smooth, open; auricles absent; ligules membranous, puberulent, acute to obtuse, often bifid or denticulate with age; blades usually glabrous, sometimes scabrous. Inflorescences panicles, moderately dense to very dense, often interrupted; disarticulation tardy, below the glumes. Spikelets laterally compressed, with 1 floret. Glumes similar, narrowly oblong to elliptic, 1-veined, apices notched, midveins extending into a short awn; calluses glabrous; lemmas shorter than the glumes, inconspicuously 5-veined, awned from just below the minutely toothed apices; paleas about 3/4 i as long as the lemmas; anthers usually indehiscent. x = 7.</description>
  <discussion>xAgropogon comprises hybrids between Agrostis and Polypogon; one hybrid grows in the Flora region.</discussion>
