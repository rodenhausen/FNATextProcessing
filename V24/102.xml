  <description type="morphology">Plants usually perennial, rarely annual. Culms (10)20-92 cm tall, 1.5-2.5 mm thick, ascending to erect from a decumbent, branching base. Sheaths glabrous, keeled; ligules 4-9 mm; blades (2)3-12 cm long, 4-8 mm wide, adaxial surfaces not papillose, apices abruptly acute. Panicles 6-30 cm long, 1-2.5 cm wide; branches 1.5-9.5 cm, ascending, with 1-5 spikelets; pedicels 1-2.5 mm. Spikelets 11-24 mm long, 1.3-3 mm wide, cylindrical and terete, except slightly laterally compressed at anthesis, rectangular in side view, with 8-15 florets. Glumes oval; lower glumes 1.4-3.5 mm; upper glumes 2.5-4.9 mm; rachilla internodes 1.2-1.8 mm; lemmas (3.5)4-6 mm, 7-veined, veins and intercostal regions scabridulous, prickles about 0.05 mm, midveins extending to within 0.1 mm of the apical margins, apices acute, with a well-developed lobe on one or both sides opposite the lateral veins, entire to crenulate between the lateral lobes; paleas exceeding the lemmas by 0.2-1(1.5) mm, keels winged, apices bifid, teeth 0.3-0.5 mm; anthers 0.5-1.4 mm, usually purple. Caryopses 1.8-2.5 mm. 2n = 20.</description>
  <discussion>Glyceria declinata is a European species that is established on the western seaboard of North America from southern British Columbia to southern California, and in northeastern Nevada, Arizona, the lower portion of the Mississippi valley, and on Long Island, New York. In Europe, it grows in low-calcium, acidic soils and tolerates drier conditions than other European species of Glyceria (Conert 1992). In Denmark, it tends to grow in areas that are highly trampled (Niels Jacobsen and Signe Frederiksen, pers. comm.). It is invading vernal pools in California.</discussion>
