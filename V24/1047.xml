  <discussion>Avena sterilis is native  from the  Mediterranean region to Afghanistan; it now grows on all continents. It has become naturalized in California, where it can be found in fields, vineyards, orchards, and on hillsides. It has been reported from Oregon, but no specimens could be found to substantiate the report. Dore & McNeill (1980) also report it from Ottawa and Guelph, Ontario. It is listed as a noxious weed by the U. S. Department of Agriculture.
