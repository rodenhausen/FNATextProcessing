  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; not rhizomatous. Culms 40-90 cm, erect; nodes (3)4-7(8), these and the internodes pubescent or glabrous. Sheaths glabrous or pilose, midrib of the culm leaves abruptly narrowed just below the collar; auricles often present on the lower leaves; ligules to 1 mm, truncate; blades 14-22(26) cm long, to 6 mm wide, flat, glabrous or pilose, not glaucous. Panicles 10-20 cm, open, nodding; branches ascending or spreading. Spikelets (14)15-30 mm, elliptic to lanceolate, terete to moderately laterally compressed, with 4-12 florets. Glumes usually pubescent, rarely glabrous; lower glumes 5-6 mm, 1-3-veined; upper glumes 6-8 mm, 3-veined, sometimes mucronate; lemmas 7-10 mm, elliptic to lanceolate, rounded over the midvein, backs and margins pubescent, apices acute to obtuse, entire; awns 1-3(5) mm, straight, arising less than 1.5 mm below the lemma apices; anthers 2-4 mm. 2n = 14.</description>
