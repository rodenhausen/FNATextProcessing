  <discussion>Secale cereale is one of the world's most important cereal grasses; it is also widely used in North America for soil stabilization and, particularly in Canada, for whisky. When dry, the spike is often distinctly nodding. Frederiksen and Petersen (1998) placed cultivated plants with a non-disarticulating rachis into Secale cereale L. subsp. cereale, and wild or weedy plants  
with more fragile rachises into S. cereale subsp. ancestrale Zhuk.
