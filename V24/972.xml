  <description type="morphology">Culms 2-35 cm, erect to decumbent, smooth, glabrous, branching at any node. Sheaths of upper leaves strongly inflated, margins expanded, enclosing the lowest spikelets; ligules to 1.5 mm; blades 1-3(10) cm long, 1-3 mm wide, adaxial surfaces scabrid. Spikes 1-15 cm, solitary, curved and twisted, rigid, with 2-20 spikelets. Spikelets 4.5-7.5 mm, usually slightly longer than the internodes, more or less cleistogamous. Glumes lanceolate, acuminate, keels rarely slightly winged; anthers 0.5-1.3 mm. 2n = 32, 36, 38, 42.</description>
  <discussion>Parapholis incurva is established at various locations on the coasts of the contiguous United States. It grows in both poorly drained and well-drained disturbed soils, at and above the high tide mark. It tends to grow in more saline soils, and at lower elevations with respect to the tide, than P. strigosa.</discussion>
