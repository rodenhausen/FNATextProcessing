  <discussion>Thinopyrum pycnanthum is native to the coasts of western and southern Europe. It is reported from scattered locations in the western United States, and from Nova Scotia to Pennsylvania in eastern North America. In its native range, it grows in maritime sands and gravels, or river gravels.</discussion>
