  <discussion>Festuca rubra subsp. commutata is extensively used for lawns and road verges. It is native to Europe, growing from southern Sweden southward, but is widely introduced elsewhere in the world. In the Flora region, it is common south of Alaska, Yukon Territory, and the Northwest Territories.</discussion>
