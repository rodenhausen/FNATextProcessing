Culms (60)70-140 cm, erect or spreading; nodes 5-9, pubescent or glabrous, often concealed by the sheaths; inter-nodes usually glabrous. Sheaths usually retrorsely pilose, someÂ¬times glabrous, with a dense line of hairs at the collar, lower sheaths often sericeous; auricles absent; ligules 0.4-1 mm, often hairy, truncate, erose, ciliolate; blades 15-30 cm long, 5-12 mm wide, often shiny yellow-green, flat, abaxial surfaces pilose, adaxial surfaces glabrous or pilose over the veins. Panicles 9-25 cm, open, nodding; branches ascending or spreading, often recurved. Spikelets 18-30 mm, elliptic to lanceolate, terete to moderately laterally compressed, often purplish, with 6-12 florets. Glumes usually pubescent; lower glumes 5.5-8 mm, l(3)-veined; upper glumes 7-10 mm, 5-veined, often mucronate; lemmas 8-13 mm, elliptic to lanceolate, rounded over the midvein, usually uniformly densely hairy, or the backs less densely so, apices acute to obtuse, entire; awns 5-8 mm, straight, arising less than 1.5 mm below the lemma apices; anthers 2.8-3.5(5) mm. 2n = 14.</description>
