  <discussion>xElyhordeum jordalii consists of hybrids between Elymus macrourus and Hordeum brachyantherum. It grows in the Brooks Range, Alaska. According to Jordal (1951), it was "only observed near settlements on the lowlands south of the range where it has a weedy habit. Dense tufts near cabins." It resembles xE. pilosilemma, which differs in having H. jubatum as the Hordeum parent.</discussion>
