  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; sometimes rhizomatous, sometimes cespitose. Culms 5-150 cm, glabrous or pubescent, basal branching extravaginal. Sheaths open the entire length or fused at the base; auricles absent; ligules membranous, often erose to lacerate, sometimes ciliolate; blades rolled in the bud. Inflorescences terminal panicles, open and diffuse to dense and spikelike; branches antrorsely scabrous. Spikelets 2.5-12 mm, usually subsessile to pedicellate, rarely sessile, laterally compressed, with 2-5 florets, reduced florets sometimes present distally; rachillas hairy, internodes evident, prolonged beyond the base of the distal bisexual florets; disarticulation usually initially above the glumes and beneath the florets, subsequently below the glumes, in some species initially below the glumes. Glumes subequal or unequal, keels scabrous, apices usually acute, unawned, often apiculate; lower glumes l(3)-veined; upper glumes 3(5)-veined, lateral veins less than 1/2 the glume length; calluses hairy; lemmas 3-7-veined, margins hyaline, unawned or awned from above the middle with a single awn, apices usually bifid, sometimes entire; paleas from subequal to longer than the lemmas, membranous, 2-veined, veins usually extending as bristlelike tips; lodicules 2, shallowly and usually slenderly lobed to fimbriate; anthers 3; ovaries glabrous or pubescent; styles 2. Caryopses shorter than the lemmas, concealed at maturity, elongate-fusiform, compressed, brown; embryos elliptic, to 1/3 the length of the caryopses; endosperm milky, x = 7. </description>
  <discussion>Trisetum, a genus of approximately 75 species, occurs primarily in temperate, subarctic, and alpine regions. Eight species are native to the Flora region; two have been introduced, one of which is not known to have persisted. Trisetum usually differs from Sphenopholis in having longer awns that are inserted lower on the lemmas, and spikelets that disarticulate above the glumes. It differs from Deschampsia primarily in its more acute, bifid lemmas. In addition, all species of Trisetum have awns that are inserted at or above the midpoint of the lemmas; in Deschampsia, the awns are usually inserted at or below midlength, often near the base.
Trisetum spicatum is important as forage on native rangelands. Like other species of the genus, it is a significant component of natural food pyramids, especially in arctic and alpine regions and mountain parks. Trisetum flavescens was introduced from Europe as a pasture grass; T. interruptum is often weedy.
Spikelet measurements do not include the awns.
