  <description type="morphology">Plants annual; tufted or the culms solitary. Culms 5-120 cm, erect or geniculate, glabrous. Leaves mostly cauline; sheaths open, rounded to slightly keeled; collars glabrous, midveins continuous; auricles absent; ligules membranous, often lacerate to erose; blades flat or weakly involute, glabrous. Inflorescences terminal panicles; branches strongly ascending to divergent. Spikelets pedicellate, slightly laterally compressed, with 1 floret, rarely more, distal florets, if present, vestigial; rachillas prolonged beyond the base of the floret as a bristle, rarely terminating in a vestigial floret; disarticulation above the glumes, beneath the floret. Glumes unequal, lanceolate, scabrous on the distal 1/2, unawned; lower glumes 1-veined; upper glumes slightly shorter than to slightly longer than the florets, 3-veined; calluses blunt, glabrous or sparsely hairy; lemmas firmer than the glumes, folded to nearly terete, obscurely 5-veined, marginal veins not excurrent, apices entire, awned, awns subterminal; paleas about 3/4  as long as to equaling the lemmas, hyaline, 2-veined; lodicules 2, free, glabrous, usually toothed; anthers 3; ovaries glabrous. Caryopses shorter than the lemmas, concealed at maturity, 1.2-2 mm, ellipsoidal, slightly sulcate; hila broadly ovate, 1/5 the length of the caryopses. x = 7. </description>
  <discussion>Apera is genus of three species, native to Europe and western Asia. It is similar to Agrostis. It differs in its firm lemmas; paleas that are always present and equal to the lemma, or nearly so; and prolonged rachillas. In North America, two species have been introduced, growing as weeds in lawns and disturbed ground, and in grain fields.</discussion>
