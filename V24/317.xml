  <discussion>Bromus sterilis is native to Europe, growing from Sweden southward. In the Flora region, it grows in road verges, waste places, fields, and overgrazed rangeland. It is widespread in western and eastern North America, but is mostly absent from the Great Plains and the southeastern states.</discussion>
