  <discussion>Dasypyrum villosum is native from southern Europe to Turkey, the Crimea, and the Caucasus. The only known North American record is a collection made in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, in 1877.
Dasypyrum breviaristatum (H. Lindb.) Fred, differs from D. villosum in being perennial and shortly rhizomatous, and in having stiff, dark green leaves, glume keels with hairs that are not in tufts, and awns to 15 mm long.
