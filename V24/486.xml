  <discussion>Elymus xpinalenoensis consists of hybrids between E. elymoides subsp. brevifolius (p. 319) and E. arizonicus (p. 329) (Pyrah 1983). It has been found in the Pinaleno and Santa Catalina mountains of Graham County, Arizona, in areas disturbed by logging, road building, summer home development, and recreation.</discussion>
