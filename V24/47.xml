  <discussion>Hygroryza aristata is native to tropical Asia, where it has occasionally been used as forage for cattle (Bor 1960). It is sold for ponds and aquaria, where its long, feathery, adventitious roots have a decorative effect, but it has the potential to become a significant weed problem in the southern United States.</discussion>
