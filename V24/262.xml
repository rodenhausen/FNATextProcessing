  <discussion>Brachypodium rupestre is native to Europe and northern Turkey; it is not known to be established in the Flora region. Specimens of this species were grown by the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Pima County, Arizona and Bernalillo County, New Mexico; they were distributed either as Brachypodium sp. or as B. cespitosum (Host) Roem. & Schult. The description is based on Schippmann (1991).</discussion>
