    <name_authority_date>Named intersectional hybrids Poa xlimosa Scribn. & T.A. Williams </name_authority_date>
  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; densely to loosely tufted or the culms solitary, shortly rhizomatous. Culms 20-80 cm, erect or the bases decumbent. Sheaths usually closed for about 1/6 their length; ligules 1-4 mm, smooth or sparsely scabrous, apices obtuse to acute; innovation blades 0.5-2 mm wide; cauline blades 0.5-5 mm wide, flat, folded, abaxial surfaces smooth or scabrous, apices narrowly prow-shaped. Panicles 5-15 cm, erect, usually contracted, sometimes interrupted; branches shorter than 4 cm, erect, angles somewhat scabrous. Spikelets 4-7 mm, weakly laterally compressed; florets 2-5; rachilla internodes smooth. Lower glumes 3-veined; calluses glabrous or webbed, hairs to 1/4 the lemma length; lemmas 2.5-4.5 mm, narrowly lanceolate, distinctly to weakly keeled, glabrous throughout or the keels and marginal veins sparsely long-villous, apices acute; palea keels scabrous; anthers aborted late in development or 1.3-2.2 mm. 2n = 64.</description>
  <discussion>Poa xlimosa grows at scattered locations in western North America. It prefers wet to moist, often saline or alkaline meadows, primarily in the sagebrush zone. It is probably a hybrid between P. pratensis (p. 522) and P. secunda subsp. juncifolia (p. 586). Vigorous artificial hybrids of this parentage have been produced; they resemble P. xlimosa.</discussion>
