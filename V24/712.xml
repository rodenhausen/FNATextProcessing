  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; not rhizomatous, not stoloniferous, loosely tufted. Basal branching mainly pseudointravaginal. Culms 31-126 cm. Sheaths closed for 1/2 - 7/8 their length; ligules 0.1-1.7(2.1) mm, smooth or sparsely scabrous, truncate to obtuse; blades 0.8-4.1 mm wide, flat, lax. Panicles 11.4-36 cm, erect or lax, narrowly pyramidal, usually open, infrequently contracted; nodes with (2)3-5(7) branches; branches spreading, straight, angled, angles sparsely to moderately scabrous. Spikelets 3.5-6.7 mm, laterally compressed; florets 2-4; rachilla internodes glabrous. Glumes ovate, distinctly keeled, keels scabrous; lower glumes 1-veined; upper glumes shorter than or subequal to the lowest lemmas; calluses webbed; lemmas 2.7-4.2(5) mm, lanceolate, distinctly keeled, keels short-villous to about midlength, marginal and lateral veins glabrous, lateral veins obscure or moderately prominent, intercostal regions glabrous, smooth, apices acute; paleas glabrous or ciliolate over the keels, apices finely scabrous; anthers 0.4-0.8 mm. 2n = unknown.</description>
