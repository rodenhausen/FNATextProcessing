Sheaths smooth or scabrous; collars usually scabrous, rarely smooth or hairy; ligules (1)4-6(12) mm; blades (11)16-31(41) cm long, (2)2.5-5(8) mm wide, adaxial surfaces usually strongly scabrous, rarely smooth, often glaucous. Panicles (9)11-14(19) cm long, (1)2-3(7) cm wide, often contracted when young, usually purplish, sometimes greenish to straw-colored; branches 2.9-4.5(5.7) cm. Spikelets 2.5-3.5(4) mm; rachilla prolongations 0.5-1 mm, hairs 2.5-3.2 mm.
