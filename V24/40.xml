  <description type="morphology">Plants usually perennial, rarely annual; terrestrial or aquatic; rhizomatous or cespitose; synoecious. Culms 20-150 cm (occasionally longer in floating mats), erect or decumbent, often rooting at the nodes, branched or unbranched. Leaves equitably distributed along the culm; sheaths open; auricles absent; ligules membranous; pseudopetioles absent; blades aerial, linear to broadly lanceolate, flat or folded, sometimes involute when dry. Inflorescences terminal panicles, usually exserted, axillary panicles sometimes also present; disarticulation beneath the spikelets. Spikelets bisexual, with 1 floret; florets laterally compressed, linear to suborbicular in sideview. Glumes absent; calluses not stipelike, glabrous; lemmas and paleas subequal, chartaceous to coriaceous, ciliate-hispid or glabrous, tightly clasping along the margins; lemmas 5-veined, obtuse or acute to acuminate, sometimes mucronate, usually unawned; paleas 3-veined, unawned; lodicules 2; anthers 1, 2, 3, or 6; styles 2, bases fused, stigmas laterally exserted, plumose. Caryopses laterally compressed; embryos about 1/3 as long as the caryopses; hila linear, x = 12.</description>
  <discussion>Leersia is a genus of about 17 aquatic to mesophytic species, growing primarily in tropical and warm-temperate regions. Five species are native to the Flora region. Leersia is closely allied to Oryza. It is unusual in the variability in stamen numbers among its species.</discussion>
