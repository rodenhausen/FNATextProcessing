  <discussion>Thinopyrum junceum is native to the coast of Portugal, the Mediterranean, and the Black Sea. In the Flora region, it has been found on the coasts of southern California and Nova Scotia. In its native range, it grows on maritime rocky coasts, shifting beach sands, and, occasionally, by brackish water near river mouths.</discussion>
