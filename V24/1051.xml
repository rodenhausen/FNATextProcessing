  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose, sometimes rhizomatous. Culms 30-200 cm, basal internodes occasionally globose. Sheaths open, not overlapping; auricles absent; ligules membranous, sometimes ciliate; blades flat or convolute. Inflorescences terminal, narrow panicles; branches spreading until after anthesis, then becoming loosely appressed to the rachises. Spikelets pedicellate, laterally compressed, with 2 florets, lower florets staminate, upper florets pistillate or bisexual, a rudimentary floret occasionally present distally; rachillas pubescent; disarticulation above the glumes, the florets usually falling together, rarely falling separately. Glumes unequal, hyaline, unawned; lower glumes less than 3/4  the length of the upper glumes, 1- or 3-veined; upper glumes 3-veined; calluses short, blunt, pubescent; lower lemmas membranous, 3-7-veined, acute, awned below midlength, awns twisted and geniculate; upper lemmas membranous to subcoriacous, glabrous or hairy, 7-veined, acute, usually unawned, sometimes awned from near the apices, awns short, straight, rarely awned similarly to the lower lemmas; paleas subequal to the lemmas, 2-veined, 2-keeled, keels scabrous or hairy, apices notched; lodicules 2, free, linear, membranous, glabrous, entire; anthers 3, 3.4-6.5 mm; ovaries pubescent. Caryopses shorter than the lemmas, concealed at maturity, not grooved, dorsally compressed to terete, hairy; hila long-linear, x = 7.
