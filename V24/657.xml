  <discussion>Lolium temulentum subsp. remotum is native to Europe, Asia, and northern Africa. It originated as a weed in flax fields, through unintentional selection for seeds that could not be separated from flax seed using early harvesting techniques. It is a rare weed in the Flora region, being reported only from southern Ontario and California, where it grows in waste places and fields.</discussion>
