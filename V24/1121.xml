  <discussion>Alopecurus myosuroides is native to Eurasia, and grows in moist meadows, deciduous forests, and cultivated or disturbed ground. A significant weed species in temperate cereal crops, it is one of the most damaging weeds of winter cereals in England. It has been introduced repeatedly as a weed of cultivation into many parts of the Flora region, but apparently has not spread to a large degree outside of cultivation. Alopecurus myosuroides has been listed as a noxious weed in the state of Washington, one of the states where winter wheat is a major crop.</discussion>
