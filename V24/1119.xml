  <discussion>Alopecurus saccatus is a native annual that inhabits moist, open meadows, valley plains, and vernal pools, at elevations below 700 m, from Washington to California. Segregates have been treated as species in the past, but the variation between them appears to be continuous, and no habitat differentiation is evident.</discussion>
