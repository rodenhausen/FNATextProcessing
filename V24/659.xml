  <discussion>Lolium persicum, a native of southwest Asia, has been found as a weed in grain fields and waste places in southern Canada, Montana, North Dakota, and Wyoming and, as an adventive, in New York and Missouri. It is now one of the top ten weeds of western Canadian cereal crops. It first became established in North America in Cavalier County, North Dakota, prior to 1910 (Dore 1950).</discussion>
