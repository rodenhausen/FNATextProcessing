  <discussion>Ampelodesmos mauritanicus is sparingly established in California: in dry oak woodlands in Napa County, and beneath a mixed evergreen canopy on Mount St. Helena in Sonoma County. It is cultivated in other parts of the United States. The plants dry out rapidly in the summer, making them fire-prone. The amount of seed set varies substantially between years. In its native range, which lies along the drier portions of the Mediterranean coast, the leaves and culms are used for mats, vine ties, brooms, baskets, and thatching.</discussion>
