  <discussion>Agropyron fragile is native from the southern Volga basin through the Caucasus to Turkmenistan and Mongolia. It is more drought-tolerant than A. cristatum. Within the Flora region, A. fragile appears to be uncommon outside of experimental plantings. This may change as more cultivars become available.</discussion>
