  <discussion>Bromus carinatus var. carinatus is primarily coastal and grows in shrublands, grasslands, meadows, and openings in chaparral and oak and yellow pine woodlands. It ranges from southern British Columbia through Washington, Oregon, and California to Baja California, Mexico, and extends eastward through Arizona to New Mexico.
Bromus carinatus var. carinatus intergrades with var. marginatus, which tends to grow at higher elevations and extends further inland.
