  <description type="morphology">Culms 20-80 cm tall, 1.5-2 mm thick, mostly glabrous, pubescent below the nodes. Basal sheath margins hairy distaily. hairs 1-3.2 mm; blades 11-30+ cm long, 2.5-4.2 mm wide, usually flat or only partly closed, sometimes completely convolute, straight to somewhat arcuate distaily. Panicles 11-15 cm long, 2-4 cm wide. Florets 5.5-6.5 mm; awns 15-35 mm; paleas sparsely hairy between the veins, hairs about 1/2 as long as the lemma hairs, apices usually rounded, occasionally somewhat pinched; anthers 3.5-4.5 mm, glabrous. Caryopses 5-6 mm, fusiform. 2n = unknown.</description>
