  <discussion>Cutandia memphitica is native to maritime sands, inland dunes, sandy gravel, and gypsum soils in the Mediterranean region and Middle East. In the Flora region, it was collected in sandy soil at a nursery at Devil's Canyon in the San Bernardino Mountains, California, in 1933. How it got there and whether it persists are not known.
