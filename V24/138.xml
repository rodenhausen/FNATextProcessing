  <discussion>Pleuropogon oregonus grows in swampy ground, wet meadows, and stream banks. It is known, even historically, from only a few locations in Union and Lake counties, Oregon. In 1975 it was thought to be extinct, but a population has since been discovered at one location in Lake County. The species is listed as threatened by the state of Oregon.</discussion>
