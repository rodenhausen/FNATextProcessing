  <description type="morphology">Plants densely to loosely tufted, often forming turf, culms clustered. Basal branching intra- and extravaginal. Culms 8-100 cm. Innovation shoot blades 10-45 cm long, 0.4-4 mm wide, some distinctly narrower than the cauline blades, all flat or some involute, usually soft, adaxial surfaces sparsely pubescent; cauline blades flat or folded. Panicles 5-18 cm, broadly pyramidal, open or somewhat contracted, with 3-5(7) branches per node; branches spreading to somewhat reflexed, smooth or sparsely to fairly densely scabrous, with several to many spikelets per branch. Spikelets lanceolate to broadly lanceolate, not bulbiferous; florets normal. Glume keels strongly compressed, sparsely to moderately scabrous; upper glumes shorter than or nearly equaling the lowest lemmas; lemmas 2.8-4.3 mm, finely muriculate, lateral veins glabrous; palea keels scabrous, glabrous, intercostal regions glabrous. 2n = 43, 44, 48,49, 50, 51, 52, 54,56, 58, 59, 62, 65, 66, 61, 74, ca. 85, ca. 86, 88, 89, 95.</description>
  <discussion>Poa pratensis subsp. pratensis grows throughout most cf the range of the species, but is absent from the high arctic, and only sporadic in the low arctic. It usually has a few narrow, flat or involute, intravaginal shoot leaves, in addition to some broader, extravaginal shoot leaves, and is intermediate between subspp. angustifolia and irrigata. For a comparison, see the descriptions of those subspecies.</discussion>
