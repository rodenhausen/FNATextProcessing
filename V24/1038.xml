  <discussion>Scolochloa festucacea grows in ponds, marshes, seasonally flooded basins, and the shallow margins of freshwater to moderately saline lakes and streams. It provides good nesting cover for some waterfowl and shorebirds, and can provide valuable forage for livestock and wildlife. It does not compete well with hybrid cattails (Typba latifolia x T. angustifolia or T. domingensis).
