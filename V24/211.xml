  <discussion>Stipa capensis is known from two locations in Riverside County, California: one in Palm Springs, and the other near the mouth of Chino Canyon. A.C. Sanders (University of California, Riverside) described the latter population as a "common annual on roadside and spreading into desert vegetation" (UTC 230476).</discussion>
