  <discussion>Holcus mollis grows in moist soil and disturbed sites, including lawns and damp pastures. It is a European introduction that has persisted in the Flora region, becoming a problematic weed in ungrazed pastures, prairie remnants, and oak savannahs in portions of the Pacific Northwest. It is also sold as an ornamental. There are two subspecies: Holcus mollis L. subsp. mollis (stems not thickened and tuberous at the base; panicles lax, brownish or purplish) and H. mollis subsp. reuteri (Boiss.) Malag. (stems thickened and tuberous at the base; panicles narrow, whitish). North American introductions belong to subsp. mollis.
