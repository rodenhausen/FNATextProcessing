  <description type="morphology">Plants rhizomatous. Culms 170-235 cm tall, 4-5 mm thick, smooth, mostly glabrous, hairy for 12-15 cm below the spikes, hairs 0.1-0.2 mm. Leaves evenly distributed on the culms; sheaths smooth, glabrous: auricles absent; ligules 0.5-0.7 mm, truncate; blades 6-10 mm wide, smooth, glabrous, abaxial surfaces with the primary veins evident, adaxial surfaces with the primary and secondary veins evident. Inflorescences spikes, 25-35 cm long, about 15 mm thick, with 2 sessile or subsessile spikelets per node; internodes 7-14 mm. Spikelets 14-20 mm excluding the awns, to 25 mm including the awns, with 2-3 florets; disarticulation above the glumes, beneath the florets. Glumes 12-25 mm long including the awns, 0.8-2 mm wide, widest near midlength, flexible, hairy, hairs about 0.4 mm, bases indurate for about 0.3 mm, 3-5 veins evident at midlength, margins about 0.5 mm wide, apices tapering into awns, awns 1-3 mm; lemmas 20-25 mm, hairy, hairs about 0.4 mm, apices awned, awns 2.5-9(11) mm; anthers 2.5-3.5 mm.</description>
