  <discussion>Taeniatherum caput-medusae is native from Portugal and Morocco east to Kyrgyzstan. It usually grows on stony soils, and flowers from May-June (July). It is an aggressive invader of disturbed sites in the western United States, where it has become a serious problem on rangelands. It has been found as a rare introduction at several sites in the eastern United States, but may not persist there. It is listed as a noxious weed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
Frederiksen (1986) recognized three subspecies within Taeniatherum caput-medusae, distinguishing among them on the basis of morphology and geography. Plants in the Flora region belong to Taeniatherum caput-medusae (L.) Nevski subsp. caput-medusae. It differs from the other two subspecies in its longer glumes and shorter lemmas.
