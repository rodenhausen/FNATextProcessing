    <name_authority_date>Elymus xcayouetteorum consists of hybrids between E. trachycaulus (p. 321) and E. canadensis (p. 303). The above description is based on the type specimen, which was collected on the Ilets Jeremie, Quebec. It is not known how widespread such hybrids are.</name_authority_date>

  <discussion>Elymus xpalmerensis is the name for hybrids between E. macrourus (p. 324) and E. sibiricus (p. 310). It is known from disturbed sites around Palmer, Alaska, and in south-central Alaska. Bowden (1967) also reported it from Fort Liard, in the MacKenzie District, Northwest Territories. Lepage (1952) originally identified the parents as Agropyron sericeum [= E. macrourus] and E. canadensis (p. 303). Later, Lepage (1965) stated that the second parent was E. sibiricus. The above description includes xAgroelymus hodgsonii Lepage, which, according to Bowden (1967), is a synonym.</discussion>
