  <description type="morphology">Plants annual. Culms 5-60 cm. Sheaths open for most of their length; auricles absent; ligules glabrous; blades flat or convolute. Inflorescences panicles; branches glabrous, scabrous, some branches longer than 1 cm, some pedicels longer than 3 mm, usually less than 1 mm thick, flexible. Spikelets pedicellate, terete to slightly laterally compressed, with (1)2 to many florets, fertile florets (1)2-6, distal florets vestigial; rachillas straight or slightly bowed, scabrous or puberulent; disarticulation above the glumes and beneath the florets. Glumes unequal in length, subequal in width, usually shorter than the adjacent lemmas, unawned; lower glumes 1-veined; upper glumes 3-veined; calluses short, blunt, glabrous; lemmas lanceolate, glabrous or the bases slightly pilose, 5-veined, veins converging distally, apices not mucronate, unawned; paleas shorter than the lemmas; lodicules 2, free, glabrous; anthers 3; ovaries glabrous. Caryopses shorter than the lemmas, concealed at maturity, linear, adhering to the lemmas and/or paleas. x = 7.
