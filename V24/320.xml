  <discussion>Bromus rubens is native to southern and southwestern Europe. It now grows in North America in disturbed ground, waste places, fields, and rocky slopes, from southern Washington to southern California, eastward to Idaho, New Mexico, and western Texas. It was found in Massachusetts before 1900 in wool waste used on a crop field; it is not established there. The record from New York represents a rare introduction; it is not known whether it is established.</discussion>
