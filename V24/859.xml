  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; rhizomatous. Culms 18-145 cm, usually erect, sometimes decumbent and rooting at the lower nodes; internodes hollow. Sheaths open to the base; auricles absent; ligules membranous; blades flat. Inflorescences terminal panicles; branches scabrous, usually densely scabrid distally; pedicels less than 0.5 mm thick. Spikelets pedicellate, laterally compressed to terete, with 2-8 florets; disarticulation above the glumes and beneath the florets. Glumes unequal, shorter than the lowest lemma, rounded to weakly keeled, membranous, veins obscure to prominent, unawned; lower glumes 1(3)-veined; upper glumes (l)3(5)-veined; calluses blunt, glabrous; lemmas membranous, rounded to weakly keeled, sometimes pubescent, particularly proximally, prominently (5)7-9-veined, veins more or less parallel, veins and interveins usually scabridulous, particularly distally, lateral veins usually reduced or absent, apices scabridulous and entire to serrate-erose, unawned; paleas subequal to the lemmas, 2-veined; lodicules 2, free, glabrous, entire or toothed; anthers usually 3; ovaries usually hairy, sometimes glabrous. Caryopses shorter than the lemmas, concealed at maturity, oblong, flattened dorsally, falling free; hila oblong, about 1/3 the length of the caryopses. x = 7. </description>
  <discussion>Torreyochloa grows in cold, wet, non-saline environments. It includes the two North American species treated below, plus two additional taxa in northeastern Asia (Koyama & Kawano 1964). Although similar to Glyceria and Puccinellia, Torreyochloa is not closely related to either (Church 1952; Soreng et al. 1990). It is distinguished from Glyceria by its open leaf sheaths, and from Puccinellia by the 7-9 (occasionally 5) prominent, rather than faint, lemma veins.</discussion>
