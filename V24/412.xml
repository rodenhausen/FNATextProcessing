  <discussion>xElyhordeum arcuatum is probably a hybrid between Elymus sibiricus and Hordeum jubatum (Mitchell and Hodgson 1965). It was described from disturbed sites around Palmer, Alaska, from which it has since been eliminated. No additional reports are known. There is no illustration because the type specimens could not be located.</discussion>
