  <discussion>The Poeae constitute the largest tribe of grasses, encompassing around 115 genera and 2500 species. The species are primarily cool-temperate to arctic in their distribution. In the Flora region, there are 63 non-hybrid genera with 344 species, and 4 hybrid genera, each of which has one species. Many of the tribe's species are well known as lawn and pasture grasses, for example, Poa pratensis (Kentucky bluegrass), Dactylis glomerata (orchard grass), and Phleum pratense (timothy).
The tribe's circumscription and its infratribal taxonomy are unclear. It is interpreted here as including generic groups that are, or have been, treated in other works as tribes (e.g., Agrostideae Dumort., Aveneae Dumort., Hainardeae Greut., and Phalarideae Dumort.). Some of these are sometimes recognized as subtribes, often with modified circumscriptions. Recent studies (e.g., Catalan et al. 1997, 2004; Soreng and Davis 1998) indicate that there are some infratribal groupings that, based on chloroplast DNA data, appear stable; other groupings do not. In addition, there is little support for the monophyly of some genera, notably Festuca and its allies.
The following key does not include these four hybrid genera: xAgropogon (Agrostis x Polypogon, p. 668), xArctodupontia (Arctopbila x Dupontia, p. 604), xDupoa (Dupontia x Poa, p. 601), and xPucciphippsia (Puccinellia x Phippsia, p. 477). They are described on the pages indicated. In the key that follows, branch measurements include spikelets, but not awns.
