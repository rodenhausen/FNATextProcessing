  <description type="morphology">Culms 50-130 cm. Ligules 1-3 (4.6) mm, truncate to obtuse, ciliolate; blades 15-80 cm long, 4-8 mm wide when flat, usually involute, 0.5-2.5 mm in diameter when involute; flag leaf blades 5-39 cm. Panicles 9-40 cm long, 10-25 mm wide, stramineous. Glumes 8-15 mm, exceeding the florets; callus hairs 1-3 mm; lemmas 8-11.5(14) mm, somewhat thicker than the glumes, apices acute, entire, unawned, rarely mucronate, mucros to 0.2 mm, subterminal; anthers 3-7 mm.</description>
  <discussion>The two subspecies overlap in their morphological characteristics and occupy similar habitats, the primary difference between them being their flowering time.</discussion>
