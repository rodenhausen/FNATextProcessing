  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; densely tufted, rarely weakly rhizomatous or stoloniferous. Sheaths closed for 1/10-1/3 their length. Panicles 2-25(30) cm. Spikelets more or less terete, lengths 3.5-5 times widths, narrowly lanceolate to lanceolate, subterete to fairly compressed, somtimes bulbiferous; florets 2-5(6), normal or bulb-forming. Glumes lanceolate to broadly lanceolate, keels indistinct, smooth or sparsely scabrous; lower glumes 3-veined; calluses terete or slightly dorsally compressed; lemmas 3-7 mm, narrowly lanceolate to lanceolate or slightly oblanceolate, weakly keeled or somewhat weakly keeled; anthers 3,1.5-3.5 mm, or aborted late in development and 0.8-1.8 mm.</description>
