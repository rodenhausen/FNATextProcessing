  <description type="morphology">Pedicels 2-11.3 mm, usually 2-8 times as long as the spikelets, gradually thickening to the apices. Spikelets 1.7-2.5 mm, spreading, divergent from the secondary branches, often purplish to reddish-purple-tinged; rachillas not prolonged or vestigial. Glumes subequal, 1.7-2.5 mm, 1-veined, acute; lower lemmas 1.3-1.8 mm, apices bifid, teeth to 0.1 mm, awns absent or to 2.6 mm, straight or geniculate; lower paleas 1-1.3 mm; upper lemmas 1.7-2.1 mm, apices bifid, teeth 0.2-0.4 mm, awned, awns 2.1-3 mm, geniculate; upper paleas 1-1.3 mm; anthers 0.2-0.4 mm, yellow-orange or purple. Caryopses 0.9-1.2 mm long, about 0.3 mm wide, glabrous.</description>
  <discussion>Aira caryophyllea var. capillaris is native to Europe, northern Africa, and western Asia. It usually grows in dry to somewhat moist, sandy loam soils of grassy banks, woodland openings, and disturbed sites such as pastures and roadsides.
Aira caryophyllea var. capillaris is the correct name for this taxon at the varietal level. If treated at the species level, its correct name is Aira elegans Willd. ex Roem. & Schult.
