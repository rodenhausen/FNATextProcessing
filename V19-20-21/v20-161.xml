  <description type="morphology">Shrubs, [8–]10–100[–200] cm. Stems erect to ascending, abundantly branched [simple], glabrous or papillate-scabrous [scabrous, sparsely hairy, often gland-dotted], usually resinous. Leaves cauline (evenly spaced [clustered at branch tips]); sessile [short-petiolate]; blades (midveins obscure [prominent]) filiform [linear, elliptic, or obovate] (flat to involute-terete), margins entire [minutely toothed] (apices obtuse to acute, sometimes apiculate), faces sparsely hairy [glabrous, papillate, scabrous], often gland-dotted [sometimes in deep pits], resinous. Heads discoid [radiate], usually clustered at branch tips, clusters few [numerous and sometimes hidden by surrounding leaves], in cymiform or racemiform [paniculiform to corymbiform] arrays. Involucres turbinate [cylindric to nearly hemispheric], (4–6 ×) 2–3[–8] mm. Phyllaries 8–30 in [2–]3–4[–5] series (mostly tan), 1-nerved (midveins evident and expanded apically, less evident to obscure proximally); mostly keeled, except innermost [convex to flat], [ovate] narrowly ovate to lanceolate or obovate [linear-lanceolate], unequal, chartaceous proximally or throughout, outer sometimes herbaceous or herbaceous-tipped, margins scarious (entire, lacerate to fimbriate), (apices acute to rounded [acuminate]) faces glabrous or sometime pustulate, usually resinous. Receptacles flat to convex, pitted, epaleate (pit borders short-scaly [short-awned]). Ray florets 0[–12, pistillate, fertile; corollas pale yellow to white]. Disc florets 3–7[–50], bisexual, fertile; corollas pale yellow [yellow to white], tubes often longer than narrowly campanulate [tubular, distally dilated] throats, lobes 5, spreading to recurved [laxly erect], narrowly lanceolate to triangular (unequal); style-branch (linear lanceolate to ovate, 0.9–2.5 mm) appendages linear to subulate. Cypselae (tan [to coppery bronze]) turbinate [cylindric, elliptic, or obovoid], mostly 5–8 nerved, faces sparsely to densely hairy; pappi persistent, of 40–50 whitish or tan, barbellate, apically attenuate bristles in 1 series. x = 9.</description>

  <discussion>Phylogenetic analyses (L. E. Urbatsch et al. 2003) demonstrated the polyphyly of genus Xylothamia G. L. Nesom, Y. Suh, D. R. Morgan &amp; B. B. Simpson and showed that some species assigned there are more closely related to Gundlachia.</discussion>
