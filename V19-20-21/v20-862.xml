  <description type="morphology">Plants 25–70+ cm; in clones and clumps (with sterile rosettes), stipitate-glandular
        distally; rhizomes branched, herbaceous becoming woody. Stems 1–3+, erect, straight,
        proximally glabrous, distally sometimes sparsely strigose, stipitate-glandular. Leaves basal
        and cauline, firm, margins slightly revolute, crenate-serrate, scabrous, apices acuminate
        and mucronate, abaxial faces usually glabrescent to ± scabrous, sometimes ± sparsely
        strigose, gland-dotted or stipitate-glandular, adaxial sparsely puberulent,
        stipitate-glandular (increasingly so distally); basal withering by flowering,
        long-petiolate, petioles slightly winged, bases dilated and sheathing, sparsely ciliate, ±
        glandular, blades ovate to elliptic-ovate, 70–120 × 40–65 mm, bases rounded to sometimes
        slightly oblique; proximal cauline long-petiolate, petioles shorter and gradually more
        broadly winged distally, blades ovate to elliptic-ovate, 55–100 × 24–65 mm, gradually
        reduced distally; distal winged-petiolate to subpetiolate or sessile, blades ovate or
        elliptic to lanceolate or oblanceolate, 10–64 × 3–18 mm, gradually reduced distally, bases ±
        clasping, margins becoming entire (arrays). Heads (3–)8–19+ in open, corymbiform arrays.
        Peduncles firm, straight, 0.4–3.5 cm, sparsely strigose, densely stipitate-glandular; bracts
        0–3, oblong-lanceolate, 3–5 mm, acute, densely stipitate-glandular. Involucres campanulate,
        (6–)7–11 mm, shorter than pappi. Phyllaries (18–)25–40 in (4–)5–6 series, appressed,
        lanceolate (outer) or lance-ovate to oblong or linear-oblong (inner; innermost longer than 7
        mm), strongly unequal, bases indurate, rounded adaxially, dark-green zones obovate to
        lanceolate (inner), ca. 1/3 distal portion, margins hyaline or often purplish (inner),
        scarious, erose, ± ciliate, apices (at least some) reflexed, ± squarrose, or twisted,
        rounded to obtuse (outer) or acute (inner), abaxial faces stipitate-glandular. Ray florets
        10–11; corollas ± purple, 13.1–13.5 × 1.6–2 mm. Disc florets 25–40; corollas cream or light
        yellow, becoming pinkish, 7.6–8.5 mm, slightly ampliate, tubes longer than narrowly
        funnelform-campanulate throats, lobes erect, lanceolate-acuminate, 0.9–1.4 mm. Cypselae dark
        reddish brown, cylindro-fusiform, compressed, ca. 3 mm (sterile or undeveloped), ribs [not
        seen], faces strigillose; pappi of tawny, (sometimes apically ± clavate) bristles 7.6–8+ mm,
        equaling disc corollas. 2n = 72.</description>

  <discussion>Eurybia ×herveyi is the F1 hybrid between E. macrophylla and E. spectabilis. L. J.
        Uttal (1962) proved its origin with artificial crosses, and pointed out that the two parents
        co-occur in some populations where their ranges overlap.</discussion>
