  <description type="morphology">Annuals, perennials [shrubs] (sometimes prickly, sap sometimes milky, e.g., Gazania).
    Leaves basal and/or cauline; alternate; petiolate or sessile; margins usually pinnately lobed to
    dissected, sometimes dentate or entire (sometimes revolute and/or prickly). Heads usually
    heterogamous (usually radiate) [homogamous, discoid], borne singly (on scapiform peduncles) [in
    corymbiform, racemiform, or umbelliform arrays, sometimes aggregated in second-order heads].
    Calyculi 0. Phyllaries usually persistent, in (2–)3–6+ series, distinct or ± connate, usually
    unequal, usually herbaceous [sometimes fleshy], margins and/or apices sometimes notably scarious
    (at least inner; sometimes prickly-ciliate). Receptacles flat to conic, epaleate [paleate]
    (often foveolate). Ray florets in 1–2 series, usually pistillate and fertile or styliferous and
    sterile, sometimes neuter (sometimes with 4–5 staminodes); corollas mostly white, yellow,
    orange, blue, red, or purple (rarely with 2 teeth opposite the 3- or 4-toothed laminae). Disc
    florets usually bisexual and fertile, sometimes functionally staminate; corollas yellow or dark
    brown to purple, actinomorphic, lobes [4–]5, narrowly triangular or lanceolate to deltate;
    anther bases obtuse to acute (sometimes ± sagittate, not tailed), apical appendages ± ovate to
    lanceolate; styles (in bisexual, fertile florets) proximally glabrous, usually distally dilated
    and ± cylindric (usually hispidulous near bases of cylinders), branches linear (sometimes
    adhering almost to minutely parted tips or essentially lacking), adaxially continuously
    stigmatic from bases to apices, apices rounded to acute, appendages essentially none. Cypselae
    usually monomorphic within heads, mostly ellipsoid, obovoid, or ovoid, ± terete, angled, or ±
    flattened, not beaked, bodies usually ribbed, sometimes winged (often sericeous, tomentulose, or
    woolly, sometimes glabrous); pappi (sometimes 0) usually persistent, usually of 4–8[–16+] scales
    in ± 2+ series, sometimes coroniform.</description>

  <discussion>Genera 16, species ca. 200 (3 genera, 4 species in the
    flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>The circumscription for Arctotideae adopted here follows that of K. Bremer (1994) and
    is narrower than that of N. T. Norlindh (1977[1978]). Arctotideae have been thought to be
    closely allied to members of Cynareae, chiefly on similarities in styles of some taxa and
    prickly, thistly habits in some taxa; such a relationship has been rejected by recent workers.
    J. L. Panero and V. A. Funk (2002) associated Arctotideae with their subfamily Cichorioideae,
    along with tribes Vernonieae, Liabeae, Cichorieae, and Gundelieae.</discussion>
  <discussion>Haplocarpha lyrata Harvey (perennials, leaves in basal rosettes, 8–15 cm, blades
    usually lyrate, abaxially lanate, peduncles scapiform, 10–25+ cm, ray corollas mostly yellow,
    abaxially green or red) has been noted as established in Florida
    (www.plantatlas.usf.edu).</discussion>
