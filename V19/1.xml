  <discussion>Genera ca. 1500, species ca. 23,000 (418 genera, 2413 species in the
    flora):</discussion>
  <discussion>Asteraceae (Compositae, “composites,” or “comps”) have long been recognized as a
    natural group, and circumscription of the group has never been controversial (although some
    authors have divided the traditional family into three or more families). A. Cronquist (1981)
    placed Asteraceae as the only family in the order Asterales within subclass Asteridae,
    associated with the Gentianales, Rubiales, Dipsacales, and Calycerales and relatively distant
    from Campanulales. On recent molecular phylogenetic data, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (2003;
    see references there for details; classification abbreviated APGII hereafter) has suggested that
    Asteraceae are better treated as part of a more widely defined Asterales within the asterids II
    informal clade (or campanulid clade; see W. S. Judd and R. G. Olmstead 2004). Judd and Olmstead
    summarized the higher-order relationships of Asteraceae as follows (in order of decreasing
    inclusiveness; synapomorphies in parentheses): asterids (ovules unitegmic and tenuinucellate,
    iridoid chemistry); core asterids (sympetaly, stamen number equal to petal number, stamen
    epipetaly, mostly 2–3-carpellate gynoecia); campanulids (early sympetaly), comprising eight
    unassigned families plus Aquifoliales, which is sister to Dipsacales, Apiales, and Asterales
    (last three sharing frequently inferior ovaries, polyacetylenes); and Asterales, which appears
    to be sister to Dipsacales-Apiales (K. Bremer et al. 2004). The order Asterales (valvate petals,
    lack of apotracheal parenchyma, storage of inulin, ellagic acid present, and, possibly, the
    presence of a plunger or brush pollen presentation mechanism) now includes the following
    families (fide APGII): Alseuosmiaceae, Argophyllaceae, Calyceraceae, Campanulaceae (optionally
    including Lobeliaceae), Goodeniaceae, Menyanthaceae, Pentaphragmaceae, Phellinaceae,
    Rousseauaceae, and Stylidiaceae. Within Asterales, Asteraceae is part of a clade (corollas with
    more or less fused lateral veins joining midvein near lobe apices, thick integuments, no
    endosperm haustorium) with the Menyanthaceae (cosmopolitan with Southern Hemisphere genera)
    basal to a more nested clade (inferior ovaries, possibly connate anthers, pollen exine with
    bifurcating columellae) comprising Asteraceae, Goodeniaceae (mainly Australia), and Calyceraceae
    (South America), the last being the immediate sister to Asteraceae (highly modified, persistent
    calyces, corolla venation patterns, unilocular and uniovulate gynoecia, pollen with intercolpar
    depressions, specialized fruits). Aggregation of flowers into heads with involucres appears to
    have been a parallel phenomenon in Calyceraceae and Asteraceae, given the determinate nature of
    the former and indeterminate (racemose) organization of the latter. Some traits typical of
    Asteraceae predate evolution of the family as a distinct clade. Relationships of Asteraceae and
    Calyceraceae have been discussed by M. H. G. Gustafsson and Bremer (1995). Synapomorphies of the
    Asteraceae clade include: calyces modified to structures called pappi, anthers connate (forming
    tubes) and styles modified to function as brushes in a specialized pollen presentation
    mechanism, ovaries each containing a single basal ovule, and production of sesquiterpene
    lactones.</discussion>
  <discussion>K. Bremer et al. (2004) gave an Early Cretaceous origin for the Asteridae and the
    basal campanulids, and a Late Cretaceous origin for the Asterales. Bremer and M. H. G.
    Gustafsson (1997) also hypothesized a Late Cretaceous ancestry of Asterales in East Gondwanaland
    (Australasia), with later expansion into West Gondwanaland (South America-Antarctica), where the
    Asteraceae originated before the final separation of South America and Antarctica. Similarly, M.
    L. DeVore and T. F. Stuessy (1995) argued that the close relationships of Asteraceae to
    Goodeniaceae and Calyceraceae, plus the basal position of Barnadesioideae K. Bremer &amp; R. K.
    Jansen (Asteraceae), indicated a South America-Antarctica-Australia origin for the complex.
    After reviewing previous hypotheses, they proposed a late Eocene origin for the complex and
    suggested a South American origin for the Asteraceae based on the basal position of the South
    American Barnadesioideae (see also Stuessy et al. 1996, on Barnadesioideae origin in southern
    South America in the Oligocene) and their sister relationship to Calyceraceae. Fossil pollen
    data (both Mutisieae and Asteroideae types—notably Heliantheae in the broad sense—among earliest
    reports) reviewed by A. Graham (1996) appear to indicate an Eocene origin for Asteraceae in
    South America, with migration to North America at least by the Oligocene, possibly as early as
    the late Eocene. More recently, M. S. Zavada and S. E. de Villiers (2000; and references
    therein) reported Asteraceae pollen (assignable to Mutisieae in the broad sense) from the
    Paleocene-Eocene of South Africa, suggesting an earlier, West Gondwana (southern Africa or
    Australia) origin for the family. Such data indicate that some tribes of Asteraceae may have
    arrived in North America via long-distance dispersal or island hopping well before closure of
    the isthmus of Panama. They also have a bearing on the possible times of radiation of some
    tribes in North America, particularly Heliantheae in the broad sense and Eupatorieae, which
    originated in the continent (including Mexico and parts of Central America), and those that came
    to North America from or through South America such as Mutisieae, Vernonieae, some Plucheeae,
    and Astereae. Other tribes, such as Cynareae, Cichorieae, some Gnaphalieae, and Anthemideae, may
    have reached North America from Eurasia, possibly via Beringia (or as Amphi-Atlantic disjuncts),
    at a later time.</discussion>
  <discussion>The bases of a tribal classification within Asteraceae were established in the
    nineteenth century, primarily through the work of H. Cassini (especially in articles scattered
    through the 61 volumes of F. Cuvier 1816–1845; Cassini included synopses of his tribes as part
    of his entry for Zoegea, i.e., zyégée in French; the articles have been collected in three
    volumes by R. M. King and H. W. Dawson 1975), C. F. Lessing (1832), A. P. de Candolle
    (1828–1838, 1836–1838), and, particularly, G. Bentham (1873). In the twentieth century, the
    tribal system of Cassini, as elaborated by Bentham, was widely followed with only slight
    modifications (see S. Carlquist 1976; A. Cronquist 1955, 1977; C. Jeffrey 1978; G. Wagenitz
    1976b; see also J. Small 1919 and, for alternate views on Heliantheae-Eupatorieae, H. Robinson
    1996).</discussion>
  <discussion>A molecular phylogenetic study by R. K. Jansen and J. D. Palmer (1987) established
    that a South American clade (later named Barnadesioideae) is basal within Asteraceae. Both
    cladistic morphologic analyses (e.g., K. Bremer 1994, 1996) and mostly chloroplast-DNA molecular
    phylogenies (e.g., Jansen et al. 1991, 1992; K. J. Kim et al. 1992; Kim and Jansen 1995; R. J.
    Bayer and J. R. Starr 1998; P. K. Eldenäs et al. 1999; B. G. Baldwin et al. 2002) have deepened
    our knowledge of tribal interrelationships within Asteraceae and led to the recent proposal of a
    phylogenetic classification for the family with 10 subfamilies and 35 tribes (J. L. Panero and
    V. A. Funk 2002).</discussion>
  <discussion>Treatment of Asteraceae here differs from some of the recently proposed
    classifications in that some groups continue to be traditionally circumscribed (e.g., Mutisieae
    in the broad sense, Heliantheae in the broad sense, including Helenieae and excluding
    Eupatorieae). Where appropriate and so far as practicable, new taxonomies are acknowledged in
    our discussions of individual tribes (which see). In North America, the following subfamilies
    and tribes, as defined by J. L. Panero and V. A. Funk (2002), are represented (tribes with no
    native representatives are marked by asterisks): Mutisioideae-Mutisieae in the strict sense,
    Gochnatioideae-Gochnatieae, and Hecastocleioideae-Hecastocleideae (all included in Mutisieae
    here, which see), Carduoideae (Cardueae = Cynareae), Cichorioideae (*Arctoteae, Cichorieae,
    Vernonieae), and Asteroideae [Senecioneae, *Calenduleae, Gnaphalieae, Anthemideae, Astereae,
    Plucheeae, *Inuleae, Eupatorieae, and the following segregates of Heliantheae in the broad sense
    (all treated here within or as subtribes of a fairly traditionally circumscribed Heliantheae):
    Bahieae, Chaenactideae, Coreopsideae, Helenieae, Heliantheae in the strict sense, Madieae,
    *Millereae, Perityleae, Polymnieae, and Tageteae)].</discussion>
  <discussion>Asa Gray produced the first broadly influential floristic synthesis of North American
    Asteraceae. Other authors who made important contributions to floristics of North American
    Asteraceae in the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries were S. F. Blake, N. L.
    Britton, R. S. Ferris, M. L. Fernald, E. L. Greene, H. M. Hall, M. E. Jones, D. D. Keck, P. A.
    Rydberg, J. K. Small, and S. Watson. Some of those authors had narrower concepts of genera and
    species than had their predecessors and they freely recognized new taxa in Asteraceae (mostly
    genera and species). Floristics of North American Asteraceae in the second half of the twentieth
    century was especially influenced by A. Cronquist (e.g., 1955, 1980, 1994; H. A. Gleason and
    Cronquist 1991), who usually favored traditional generic circumscriptions.</discussion>
  <discussion>In the last 20 years or so, developments in molecular systematics have led to
    revisions of generic limits in some tribes of Asteraceae and, sometimes, to a return to generic
    concepts that had been suggested earlier but largely ignored. More or less worldwide, taxonomies
    in some tribes or parts of tribes have included segregate genera that have been revived or newly
    published. Most of the innovations will be summarized in the forthcoming Asterales volume of K.
    Kubitzki et al. (1990+). The generic circumscriptions adopted here incorporate recent taxonomic
    findings relevant to North America, insofar as our contributors have accepted them. As a result,
    many of the genera treated herein have never been presented in a major flora before, and some
    species are included within genera with which they were not associated traditionally. Thus, the
    Flora brings together much new knowledge and many new names. In most instances, circumscriptions
    of species have turned out to be conventional. So far as practicable, recently named species
    from North America have been accounted for within relevant treatments herein.</discussion>
  <discussion>With 418 genera and 2413 species (Table 1), Asteraceae is, numerically, the largest
    family in the flora of North America north of Mexico. Members of the family are found in diverse
    habitats, from the High Arctic tundra and polar deserts to the Sonoran warm-desert scrub, and
    from alpine habitats to salt marshes. Asteraceae are particularly conspicuous elements of
    warm-desert and intermountain grasslands, as well as of desert scrubs, notably the intermountain
    desert scrub where Artemisia dominates (M. G. Barbour and N. L. Christensen 1993). Among other
    conspicuous species, members of Solidago and Symphyotrichum form a very showy part of the fall
    flowering in eastern North America, and members of Heliantheae sometimes produce striking
    displays in the American West (e.g., Gaillardia spp., Lasthenia spp., members of
    Madiinae).</discussion>
  <discussion>Much has been published, not only on systematics (at various levels), but on biology,
    chemistry, and economic and medical uses of Asteraceae worldwide, particularly in proceedings
    (from conferences and symposia) edited by V. H. Heywood et al. (1977), T. J. Mabry and G.
    Wagenitz (1990), and D. J. N. Hind et al. (1995, 1996).</discussion>
  <discussion>Relatively few North American species of Asteraceae are economically important or
    widely used ethnobotanically. The only major Asteraceae crop of North American origin is the
    sunflower, Helianthus annuus, which is valued for its seed oil and is appreciated in the
    horticultural trade. Other crop plants from native species worth mention are Helianthus
    tuberosus, the Jerusalem artichoke, and Parthenium argentatum, the guayule, a source of rubber.
    Echinacea spp. are touted as health plants. Members of several genera of Asteraceae native to
    the flora are grown for their ornamental value, notably species of Coreopsis (tickseeds),
    Echinacea (coneflowers), Helianthus (sunflowers), Liatris (blazingstars and gayfeathers),
    Rudbeckia (black-eyed Susans), Solidago (goldenrods), and Symphyotrichum (“asters” of the
    trade).</discussion>
  <discussion>Many species of Asteraceae have been introduced into North America, mainly from Europe
    and Asia, some deliberately for medicines, foods, or horticulture, others accidentally (often
    with seeds or other agricultural products or by other means). Few, if any, of the introduced
    taxa are thought to be noxious at the continental level, but some (e.g., Acroptilon) are
    considered noxious in large parts of their ranges within the flora. Taraxacum officinale is a
    common lawn weed that (in terms of dollars spent and herbicides applied in weed control) has an
    economic and ecologic impact disproportionate to the actual harm it causes; other weedy
    introduced Asteraceae are of little economic consequence. Some native Asteraceae are toxic to
    cattle and other livestock and are therefore considered weeds. And some native species of open
    habitats (e.g., Symphyotrichum pilosum) are often considered weeds because they invade fields
    left fallow. Ragweeds (especially Ambrosia artemisiifolia and A. trifida) range over nearly the
    whole continent and their wind-blown pollens cause late-summer allergic reactions (hayfever) for
    a large number of people. Because ragweeds have a large impact on human health, they have a
    significant, negative economic impact.</discussion>
  <discussion>In contrast to Orchidaceae, for which a wealth of excellent, well-illustrated popular
    books are available, few popular field guides on Asteraceae of North America have been
    published. The guide by T. M. Antonio and S. Masi (2001) deserves notice for its maps, color
    photographs, and useful information.</discussion>
  <discussion>Composites (members of Asteraceae) share some unusual morphologic traits and some
    morphologic terms are used in particular ways as applied here to them.</discussion>
  <discussion>For treatments of composites here, “perennials” are herbaceous and differ from annuals
    and biennials in living longer than two years and differ from subshrubs, shrubs, and trees in
    not developing woody aerial stems.</discussion>
  <discussion>In most composites, leaf venation comprises a midrib plus more or less equal lateral
    nerves or veins; such leaves are described as pinnately nerved. Venation in leaf blades of some
    composites often consists of a midrib plus relatively strong lateral veins that diverge at or
    just distal to bases of blades. Such leaves are described as 3-nerved, 3(–5)-nerved, 5-nerved,
    etc., and, as appropriate, the phrases “from bases” or “distal to bases” may be added for
    clarification.</discussion>
  <discussion>Composites often have subsessile to sessile or sunken glandular hairs that consist of
    multicellular bases supporting globular elements that usually contain resinous or sticky
    substances. Such structures have been called glands, glandular hairs, glandular trichomes,
    punctae, resin dots, and so on. Sometimes, the glands are embedded in epidermal depressions or
    pits. Epidermes with glands more or less sunk into or embedded within the surface have been
    called glandular-punctate and/or punctate-glandular. The glands may be colorless (translucent)
    or yellowish to dark brown or orange and are sometimes more prominent on dried specimens than in
    living plants. In keys and descriptions here, gland-dotted refers to the presence of such
    glandular hairs, whether sessile or in depressions or pits (as appropriate, “in pits” or
    “sessile” may be added for clarification).</discussion>
  <discussion>Inflorescences of composites are called heads (or capitula, sing. capitulum). Heads
    may be borne singly (i.e., not clearly associated with other heads on the same plant) or
    associated in arrays. The arrays of heads on composites correspond to arrays of individual
    flowers (inflorescences) on plants of other families; arrays of heads are sometimes called
    capitulescences. Terms for architectural structures of arrays of heads are parallel to terms for
    kinds of inflorescences: cymiform, corymbiform, paniculiform, racemiform, spiciform, thyrsiform,
    etc.</discussion>
  <discussion>In radiate heads, peripheral florets (ray florets) in one or more series have corollas
    with zygomorphic limbs and may be pistillate, or styliferous and sterile, or neuter; the central
    florets (disc florets) in radiate heads have ± actinomorphic corollas and may be bisexual or
    functionally staminate. In liguliflorous heads, all florets are bisexual and (usually) fertile
    and have zygomorphic corollas (ligulate florets); liguliflorous heads are characteristic of
    Cichorieae and are found in no other composites. In discoid heads, all florets have ±
    actinomorphic corollas and all are either bisexual and fertile or all are either functionally
    staminate or pistillate (in monoecious or dioecious taxa, e.g., Baccharis spp.). In disciform
    heads, all florets have ± actinomorphic corollas, and peripheral florets (in one or more series)
    are usually pistillate and usually have relatively slender (often filiform) corollas. Such
    peripheral pistillate florets are generally thought to be derived by reduction from ray florets,
    and plants with disciform heads are generally thought to be derived from ancestors with radiate
    heads. The central florets of disciform heads are usually bisexual, sometimes functionally
    staminate. By tradition and for simplicity, both the peripheral, pistillate florets and the
    inner, bisexual or functionally staminate florets in disciform heads may be referred to as
    “disc” florets. In radiant heads, all florets have ± actinomorphic corollas and the peripheral
    florets usually have much enlarged corollas and may be bisexual, pistillate, or neuter; the
    central florets of radiant heads are usually bisexual. Some composites have peripheral, bisexual
    florets with slightly to strongly zygomorphic corollas (e.g., some members of Chaenactis,
    Lessingia, Thymophylla, et al.); heads of such plants do not quite conform to any of the five
    types just described and such heads may be referred to as “quasi-radiate” or “quasi-radiant.”
    Some florets in heads of some Mutisieae have 2-lipped corollas and those heads may be called
    “quasi-radiate” or “quasi-liguliflorous.” The term eradiate is used to refer collectively to
    discoid, disciform, and radiant heads.</discussion>
  <discussion>Heads with all florets of one sexual form (bisexual, pistillate, or functionally
    staminate) are called homogamous (discoid and liguliflorous heads are homogamous, some radiant
    heads may be homogamous) and heads with florets of two or more sexual forms are called
    heterogamous (radiate and disciform heads are heterogamous, some radiant heads may be
    heterogamous).</discussion>
  <discussion>Phyllaries collectively constitute an involucre, usually number 5–21(–50+), usually
    are unequal (outermost usually shorter than the inner), and usually are arranged ± imbricately
    (overlapping like shingles) in 3–5(–15+), usually ± spiral series. Sometimes, the phyllaries are
    ± equal in 1–2 series; they are rarely wanting (e.g., Psilocarphus spp.). Phyllaries may be
    herbaceous or chartaceous to scarious and are often medially herbaceous with chartaceous to
    scarious borders and/or apices. The phyllaries “proper” are sometimes immediately subtended by a
    calyculus (pl. calyculi) of (1–)3–15+ distinct, usually shorter bractlets in 1(–3+) series
    (e.g., Coreopsis spp., Taraxacum spp.).</discussion>
  <discussion>Receptacles may bear paleae (i.e., some or all florets are individually subtended by a
    bractlet called a palea or receptacular bract). Collectively paleae have been called “chaff” and
    paleate receptacles have been described as “chaffy.” Receptacles that bear paleae are referred
    to as paleate and receptacles that never bear paleae are referred to as epaleate. Epaleate
    receptacles sometimes bear subulate enations (e.g., some Gaillardia spp.) or bristles or
    subulate to linear scales (e.g., some Cynareae), or fine hairs (e.g., some Anthemideae).
    Epaleate receptacles (and paleate receptacles that have shed their paleae) may be smooth or
    pitted (alveolate, foveolate, etc.).</discussion>
  <discussion>The terms tube, throat, and limb have been variously used in descriptions of corollas
    of composites. Here, in ± actinomorphic corollas of bisexual and functionally staminate disc
    florets, the tube is the part of the corolla proximal to the insertion of the staminal
    filaments, and the limb is the part that is distal to insertion of the filaments. The limb
    comprises, proximally, the throat and, distally, the lobes. The distinction between tube and
    throat hinges on insertion of filaments, not on external morphology.</discussion>
  <discussion>The relatively flat portion of a corolla of a ligulate floret from a liguliflorous
    head (i.e., members of Cichorieae) is called a ligule; it terminates in 5 teeth or lobes. The
    relatively flat portion of a corolla of a ray floret is called a lamina; it terminates in
    0–3(–4) teeth or lobes. More or less bilabiate corollas are characteristic of some members of
    Mutisieae and are seldom found in members of other tribes.</discussion>
  <discussion>Fruits of composites have been called “achenes” because they resemble true achenes.
    Achenes are dry, hard, single-seeded fruits derived from unicarpellate, superior ovaries.
    Ovaries of composites are bicarpellate and inferior. Fruits derived from ovaries of composites
    are called cypselae (sing. cypsela, a term coined by C. de Mirbel in 1815). Morphology of an
    ovary of a composite at flowering is often markedly different from the morphology of the mature
    fruit (cypsela) derived from that ovary. References to cypselae in keys and descriptions here
    almost always refer to mature fruits, not to ovaries at flowering.</discussion>
  <discussion>Shapes of cypselae have been used in distinguishing among species, genera, and even
    subtribes of composites. In most composites, cypselae are ± isodiametric in cross section. In
    some composites, cypselae are characteristically ± lenticular to elliptic in cross section. Such
    cypselae are said to be compressed (or laterally flattened) if the longer axis of the cross
    section is ± parallel to a radius of the head (e.g., Verbesina spp.). Cypselae are said to be
    obcompressed (or radially flattened) if the shorter axis of the cross section is ± parallel to a
    radius of the head (e.g., Coreopsis spp.).</discussion>
  <discussion>In composites, pappi (sing. pappus) are found where calyces are usually found on
    inferior ovaries; pappi have been shown to be greatly modified calyces. They show a great range
    of diversity and are often diagnostic for recognition of taxa, especially at rank of genus and
    below. The forms of individual pappus elements intergrade. For keys and descriptions here, the
    following distinctions are made: cross sections of bristles and awns are ± circular or polygonal
    and have the longer diameter of the cross section no more than 3 times the shorter diameter.
    Pappus elements with “flatter” cross sections (i.e., longer diameter more than 3 times the
    shorter diameter) are called scales, regardless of relative overall lengths and widths of the
    elements. As used here, “subulate scale” and “setiform scale” mean much the same as “flattened
    bristle” of some authors. Pliable to stiff pappus bristles with diameters less than ca. 50 mm
    are called fine bristles; pliable to stiff bristles with diameters 50–100 mm are called coarse
    bristles. Rigid pappus elements with ± circular or polygonal cross sections greater than 100 mm
    in diameter are called awns. Bristles, awns, and scales may be smooth or finely to coarsely
    barbed or plumose. A scale of a pappus may terminate in one or more bristlelike or awnlike
    appendages; such scales are said to be aristate.</discussion>
  <discussion>In keys and descriptions, “pappus” and “pappi” usually refer to structures found on
    cypselae (mature fruits), not to “immature pappi” of ovaries at flowering. Sometimes pappi of
    ovaries that do not form fruits (e.g., in functionally staminate florets of some tarweeds) may
    be taxonomically useful and may be referred to in descriptions and keys.</discussion>
  <discussion>Following is a synoptic key to tribes into which genera of composites of the
      flora area are placed. Keys to genera within each tribe will be found in the accounts of the
      individual tribes. Because some traits in the key to tribes and in keys to genera within
      tribes may be difficult to assess, we have also provided a key to artificial groups of
      composites and keys to genera within those artificial groups. Those keys will be found
      following the key to tribes.</discussion>
  <discussion>In the following key, “radiate heads” have ray florets; “eradiate heads” lack
      ray florets and may be disciform, discoid, or radiant. Ray florets have zygomorphic corollas
      with laminae; the laminae may be showy (as in some species of Helianthus) or inconspicuous (as
      in some species of Erigeron). Usually, we have included plants with inconspicuous ray laminae
      in keys to genera of both radiate and eradiate groups.</discussion>
  <discussion>Some plants have questionably paleate or epaleate receptacles. Epaleate
      receptacles of some plants are notably pitted and have fimbriate to deeply lacerate pit
      borders; such receptacles have sometimes been interpreted as paleate. Plants with notably
      lacerate pit borders are usually keyed here as both paleate and epaleate.</discussion>
  <discussion>Some plants with pappi of conspicuous bristles often have the bristles subtended
      by minute, inconspicuous scales. Although such plants technically belong to groups with pappi
      “wholly, or partially, of awns or scales,” they are usually also keyed here in groups
      characterized as having pappi “wholly of bristles,” because the scales are easily overlooked.
      As well, some pappus elements are borderline between being called subulate or setiform scales
      or being called “flattened bristles.” Consequently, some plants that technically belong to
      groups with pappi of scales are keyed both in groups with pappi “wholly of bristles” and in
      groups with pappi “wholly, or partially, of awns or scales.”</discussion>
