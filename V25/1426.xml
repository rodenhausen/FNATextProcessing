  <discussion>Setaria pumila subsp. pallidefusca is native to tropical Africa. It is now established as a weed in southÂ¬eastern Louisiana, but it has also been collected in the past on ballast dumps in Portland, Oregon.
Reports of S. nigrirostris (Nees) T Durand & Schinz in North America have not been verified. It differs from S. pumila in being a rhizomatous perennial with spikelets 3.5-5 mm long and bristles with thickened tips (those of S. pumila are slender throughout). It is a native of southern Africa.
