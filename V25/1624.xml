  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; scrambling. Culms 0.5-2 m, ascending to decumbent, often rooting at the nodes, branched. Leaves not aromatic; sheaths open, at least the outer margins pubescent, usually with papillose-based hairs; ligules membranous, fimbriate or ciliate; blades ovate to ovate-lanceolate. Inflorescences terminal and axillary, panicles of subdigitate, often flabellate, clusters of rames; rame internodes not sulcate; disarticulation in the rames, beneath the sessile spikelets. Spikelets in heteromorphic sessile-pedicellate pairs or appearing solitary and sessile, pedicels greatly reduced and lacking spikelets. Sessile spikelets bisexual, with 2 florets; calluses absent or blunt; glumes equal or subequal; lower florets sterile, reduced to an unawned lemma; upper florets bisexual, awned (rarely unawned); anthers 2 or 3. Pedicels 0.2-3 mm, not thickened, not fused to the rame axes. Pedicellate spikelets absent or rudimentary, x = 9, 10. </description>
