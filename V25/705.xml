  <discussion>Calamovilfa curtissii is a rare species, although someÂ¬times locally common. It is restricted to two disjunct regions in Florida. Most Gulf coast populations grow in moist flatwoods or adjacent to wet cypress depressions; Atlantic coast populations occur in interdune swales.</discussion>
