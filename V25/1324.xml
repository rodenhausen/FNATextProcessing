  <common_names>Urochloa brizantha, a native of tropical Africa, was first reported from the Flora region in 1993 (Fox and Hatch 1995). It is considered a sporadic introduction in the Flora area.
Clayton and Renvoize (1982) report that Urochloa brizantha intergrades with U. decumbens (Stapf) R.D. Webster, and intermediates are often difficult to separate, although they do not seem to be very common in the wild. The forms widely introduced throughout the trop¬ics as forage were selected from among these intermedi-ates. The selection most commonly used as a forage has the inflorescence characters of U. brizantha and the habit features of U.  decumbens. Davidse and Pohl (1994) reported that the material introduced into Mesoamerica is referable to U. decumbens. Although U. decumbens has not been reported in the Flora area, it is expected in Florida, because it is widely used as forage in the tropics. The two taxa can be distinguished by their panicle branches: Urochloa decumbens has flat, ribbonlike panicle branches 1-1.8 mm wide, whereas U. brizantha has crescentric panicle branches 0.5-1.2 mm wide.

HAIRY SIGNALGRASS</common_names>
  <description type="morphology">Plants annual; loosely tufted or sprawling. Culms 7-50 cm, geniculate, decumbent to prostrate at the base, often much-branched below, usually rooting at the nodes; nodes pubescent; Sheaths usually pubescent, sometimes densely so, rarely glabrous, margins ciliate; ligules 0.3-1.1 mm, blades 1-7 cm long, 2-9.3 mm wide; usually densely puberulous on both sides, margins basally ciliate or scabrous. Panicles (1.5)4.5-8 cm long, with 4-12 spike¬like primary branches in 2 ranks; primary branches 0.7-3.3 cm, axes 0.2-0.3 mm wide, triquetrous, pubescent; secondary branches rarely present, pedicels shorter than the spikelets. Spikelets 2-2.8 mm, solitary (or paired), in 1 row, appressed to the branch axes. Glumes separated by about 0.3 mm; lower glumes 0.7-1.5 mm, 1/3 – 1/2 as long as the spikelets, 3-veined; upper glumes glabrous or pubescent; 5-veined, lower florets sterile; lower lemmas similar to the upper glumes; lower paleas present; upper lemmas 1.8-2.1 mm, granulose to rugulose, acute, mucronate; anthers 0.9-1.3 mm. 2n = 36. </description>
  <discussion>Urochloa villosa is a tropical African and Asian species that Reed (1964) reported collecting from chrome and iron ore piles in Newport News, Virginia in 1959. His voucher specimens, acquired by the Missouri Botanical Garden in 2001, were not available for examination prior to publication of this volume, so the description is from Veldkamp (1996) and Clayton and Renvoize (1982). No additional collections have been reported in the Flora area.</discussion>
