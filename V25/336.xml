  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose to shortly stoloniferous. Culms 20-50 cm. Sheaths glabrous; ligules membranous, ciliolate; blades to 15 cm long, 1-1.5 mm wide, glabrous or scabrous. Panicles digitate, with 3-9 branches; branches 4-17 cm, evidently distinct, becoming horizontal, spikelet-bearing to the base or within 0.5 cm of the base, distal portion with 3-7 spikelets per cm. Spikelets appressed, with 1 bisexual and 1 sterile floret. Lower glumes 0.9-1.8 mm; upper glumes 2-2.9 mm; lowest lemmas 2.9-4 mm, linear to narrowly lanceolate, mostly glabrous or scabrous, margins glabrous or with a few short, appressed hairs near the apices, 1-3-awned, central awns 7.5-17 mm, lateral lobes unawned or with awns less than 0.4 mm; second florets 1.2-1.9 mm, narrowly elliptic, bilobed for 1/3â€“1/2 of their length, apices acute, awned from between the lobes, awns 4.5-9.5 mm. Caryopses about 2.2 mm long, about 0.4 mm wide, narrowly ellipsoid. 2n = unknown.</description>
