  <discussion>In Japan, Hakonechloa macra grows on rocks along rivers. Although rhizomatous, it is not an invasive species and is recommended for mass planting. Three forms are cultivated: forma alboaurea Makino ex Ohwi, with white- and yellow-striped leaves; forma albovariegata Makino ex Ohwi, with white-striped leaves; and forma aureola Makino ex Ohwi, with yellow leaves having narrow green stripes. This last form is the one most commonly available in the Flora region.</discussion>
