  <discussion>Thysanolaena latifolia is an important pasture species in Asia. It is grown in the United States as an ornamental plant, recommended for frost-free areas with full sunlight or light shade. It is not known to be established in the Flora region.
The species has been known as Thysanolaena maxima (Roxb.) Kuntze, but Baaijens and Veldkamp (1991) demonstrated that T. latifolia has priority at the species level.
