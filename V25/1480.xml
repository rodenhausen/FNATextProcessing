  <discussion>Paspalum setaceum var. setaceum grows in open areas and sandy soils, often at the edges of forests, primarily on the southeastern coastal plain of the United States, from southern New England to eastern Mexico, but extending inland to western Virginia, Missouri, and Arkansas. It also grows in Cuba. </discussion>
