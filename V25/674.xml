  <discussion>Aristida purpurea var. perplexa grows in sandy to rocky plains and on mesas in desert grassland and scrub communities, often in calcareous soils, in both the Flora region and Mexico. It is sometimes confused with A. pansa, which differs in having cobwebby hairs at the collar, equal glumes, and shorter awns.</discussion>
