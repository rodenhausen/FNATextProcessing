  <discussion>Swallenia alexandrae grows on sand dunes in Inyo County, California. It is only known from four sites, all between 900-1200 m, in the Eureka Valley of northern Inyo County. At these sites, it forms dense colonies 1-2 m across. It is state-listed as rare and federally-listed as endangered because of off-road vehicle activity.</discussion>
