  <description type="morphology">Plants annual. Culms 20-250 cm; nodes glabrous. Sheaths glabrous, sometimes scabridu-lous, margins ciliate distally; ligules 1-2 mm, ciliate; blades to 20 cm long, 4-25 mm wide, flat, scabrous or smooth, glabrous. Panicles 3-20 cm, densely spicate, nodding only from near the apices; rachises hispid and villous; bristles 1-3, 5-10 mm, antrorsely scabrous, usually green, rarely purple. Spikelets 1.8-2.2 mm. Lower glumes about as long as the spikelets, triangular-ovate, 3-veined; upper glumes nearly equaling the upper lemmas, elliptical, 5-6-veined; lower lemmas slightly exceeding the upper lemmas, 5-veined; lower paleas about as long as the lower lemmas, hyaline; upper lemmas very finely and transversely rugose, pale green, 5-6-veined; upper paleas similar to the upper lemmas. 2n = 18.

  <discussion>Setaria viridis resembles S. italica but differs in its shorter spikelets and rugose upper florets, and mode of disarticulation. It is also a more aggressive weed. It is native to Eurasia but is now widespread in warm temperate regions of the world.</discussion>
