    <name_authority_date>Panicum capillare subsp. hillmanii (Chase) Freckmann & Lelong</name_authority_date>
  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Culms often stout and stiff, usually bluish-green, usually not branching at the base. Blades thick, firm. Panicle branches stiff; secondary branches and pedicels usually appressed, varying to narrowly divergent. Spikelets 2.2-3 mm. Lower paleas 1-1.8 mm; mature upper florets nigrescent, with a prominent lunate scar at the base.</description>
  <discussion>Panicum capillare subsp. hillmanii grows in weedy habitats in California, New Mexico, Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. It may be a southern Great Plains extension of the western plants of subsp. capillare that are sometimes called P. capillare var. occidentale Rydb., but it differs from subsp. capillare in more charÂ¬acters than such plants.</discussion>
