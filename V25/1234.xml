  <description type="morphology">Plants slender to robust. Culms to 100 cm, often spreading to decumbent and rooting at the lower nodes, branching freely distally. Blades 5-12 mm wide, spreading, those of the flag leaves usually more than 1/3 as long as the panicles. Panicles about 1/2 as long as the plant, exserted; secondary branches divergent; pedicels divergent, flexible, scabrous. Spikelets 1.9-2.4 mm. Upper glumes and lower lemmas acuminate, straight; upper florets about 1/2 as wide as long, stramineous, not disarticulating.</description>
  <discussion>Panicum philadelphicum subsp. gattingeri is commonly found in fields, roadsides, and wet clay on receding shores. This subspecies seems to be more common in the warmer parts of the northeastern United States.</discussion>
