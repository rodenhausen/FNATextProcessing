  <discussion>Cenchrus brownii is native to sandy waste places and forest borders. It occurs infrequently on the coastal plain of the southeastern United States, but is common through the Caribbean, Central America, and the northern coast of South America.  It has also been introduced to other parts of the world. The record from Texas may represent an introduction; only one specimen is known from the state.</discussion>
