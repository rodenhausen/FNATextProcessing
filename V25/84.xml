  <discussion>Leptochloa chloridiformis is native to Uruguay, southern Paraguay, and northern Argentina. It was introduced in the early part of the twentieth century but has not become established in the Flora region. The only known collections are from Cameron County, Texas, the most recent having been made in the 1940s.</discussion>
