Leaves green; sheaths glabrous; ligules 0.5-1.5 mm; blades 23-40 cm long, 7-12 mm wide, flat, glabrous. Panicles terminal, 15-22 cm long, 15-21 mm wide, fully exerted from the sheaths, flexible, drooping, green; rachises terete, puberulent. Fascicles 24-49 per cm; fascicle axes 0.4-0.5 mm, with 1 spikelet; most bristles only slightly longer than the spikelets; outer bristles 27-41, 2.4-8.5 mm; inner bristles 3-5, 6.2-11 mm, scabrous; primary bristles 7.6-11.8 mm, not noticeably longer than the other bristles, scabrous. Spikelets 5.2-6.6 mm, sessile; lower glumes 1.7-2.9 mm, 1-veined; upper glumes 4.5-6.3 mm, about as long as the spikelets, (7)9-veined; lower florets sterile; lower lemmas 4.8-6 mm, 7-veined, acuminate to attenuate, midvein excurrent for 0-0.6 mm; lower paleas absent; upper lemmas 4.9-6 mm, 5-veined, acuminate to attenuate, midvein excurrent for 0-0.6 mm; anthers 1.3-1.7 mm. 2n = 36.</description>
