Cauline leaves 3-7, glabrous or almost glabrous throughout; ligules almost obsolete, usually of hairs shorter than 0.8 mm, sometimes with a minute membranous base; blades firm, thick, margins cartilaginous, bases cordate, ciliate. Spikelets 1-1.8 mm, spherical to broadly obovoid, puberulent or someÂ¬times glabrous. Upper florets blunt or minutely umbonate.</description>
