  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or weakly perennial. Culms 5-170 cm, hollow. Sheaths glabrous or scabrous; ligules 2-8 mm, membranous, attenuate, becoming lacerate at maturity; blades 3-50 cm long, 2-7 mm wide, glabrous or scabrous, those of the flag leaves sometimes exceeding the panicles. Panicles (1.5)10-105 cm long, 0.5-22 cm wide, with 3-35 racemose branches, bases of the panicles sometimes remaining enclosed in the upper leaf sheaths at maturity; branches 1.5-20(22) cm, ascending to reflexed. Spikelets 5-12(14) mm, with 6-20 florets. Lower glumes 1-3(4.9) mm; upper glumes 1.8-5.5 mm; lemmas 2-6 mm, sometimes with a dark spot near the base, apices acute to truncate, sometimes emarginate to bifid, unawned, mucronate, or awned; paleas somewhat sericeous along the veins; anthers 1-3, 0.2-2.7 mm. Caryopses 0.8-2.4 mm, elliptic to ovate or obovate. 2n = 20.</description>
  <discussion>Leptochloa fusca grows in warm areas throughout the world. The two American subspecies, subsp. uninervia and subsp. fascicularis, are usually distinct, but they intergrade repeatedly with L. fusca subsp. fusca.</discussion>
