  <discussion>Hackelochloa granulans is a native of the Eastern Hemisphere that has become established in cultivated land, roadsides, and weedy areas of the southern region of the United States. Its range extends south through Mexico and Central and South America. Hitchcock (1951) reported it from New Mexico, but it is not established there (Allred 1993).</discussion>
