  <description type="morphology">Plants with firm, knotty, shortly rhizomatous bases. Culms 60-180 cm. Sheaths keeled, mostly glabrous, collars pubescent; ligules to 0.5 mm, membranous, ciliate; blades 3-10 mm wide, glabrous or sparsely hispid, apices attenuate and involute.  Panicles 15-40 cm long, 3-5 cm wide, erect or nodding; branches 10-15(25) cm, strongly divergent to drooping, stiff or lax, lower branches naked for 1/3 â€“ 1/2 of their length; pedicels 3-8 mm. Spikelets 5-10 mm long, with 4-8 florets. Lower glumes 2.5-3 mm, often mucronate; upper glumes 3.5-4 mm; lemmas 3-5 mm, lateral veins puberulent or ciliate to well above midlength, midveins and lateral veins usually excurrent, midveins extending to 0.5 mm, lateral vein extensions shorter; paleas as long as the lemmas, widened below; anthers 1-1.5 mm. Caryopses 1.8-2 mm. 2n = 40.</description>
