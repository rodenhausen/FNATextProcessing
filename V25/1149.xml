Culms 20-75 cm, with papillose-based hairs; fall phase branching from the mid-and upper culm nodes. Cauline leaves 4-7; sheaths glabrous or hirsute, hairs sometimes papillose-based; ligules 0.5-5 mm, of hairs, these often joined at the base into a thickened ring. Spikelets 2.5-4.3 mm, ellipsoid to obovoid, turgid. Upper glumes usually with an orange or purplish spot at the base, with 7-9 prominent veins.
