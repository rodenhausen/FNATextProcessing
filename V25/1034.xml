  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose or loosely colonial, rhizomatous. Culms 35-150 cm, simple or branched. Leaves cauline; ligules membranous, ciliate; blades not pseudopetiolate, flat. Panicles open or contracted, sometimes becoming racemose distally; disarticulation above the glumes and between the florets. Spikelets 4-50 mm, laterally compressed, with 2-many florets, lower 1-4 florets sterile. Glumes 2, subequal, shorter than the spikelets, glabrous, (2)3-9-veined, acute to acuminate; lemmas glabrous, 3-15-veined, compressed-keeled, keels serrate or ciliate, apices acuminate to acute, entire (rarely bifid); paleas glabrous, gibbous basally, 2-keeled, keels winged, wings glabrous, scabrous, or pilose; lodicules 2, fleshy, cuneate, 2-4-veined, lobed-truncate; anthers 1; ovaries glabrous; styles 2; style branches 2, plumose, reddish-purple at anthesis. Caryopses 1.9-5 mm, laterally compressed, brown to reddish-black or black, x = 12. </description>
  <discussion>Chasmanthium, a genus of five species endemic to North America, grows primarily in the southeastern and south-central parts of the United States. It was formerly included in Uniola, but it is now recognized as a distinct genus.</discussion>
