  <discussion>Pennisetum macrourum is native to Africa, where it grows along rivers and lake margins. In the Flora region, it is known only from one location in Monterey County, California. Although sometimes recommended as an ornamental grass, the U.S. Department of Agriculture considers it a noxious weed.</discussion>
