  <discussion>Sporobolus  tenuissimus  is  native  to  the Western Hemisphere, and introduced to Africa and Asia. Its native distribution in the Americas is tropical, extending from southern Mexico to Brazil and Paraguay. It has been found at a few locations in the southeastern United States, at 0-100 m. It grows in disturbed areas, often occurring as a weed in gardens and cultivated fields.</discussion>
