  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; usually decumbent, rooting at the nodes. Culms 30-130 cm, decumbent; nodes glabrous or pubescent. Sheaths glabrous or pubescent; ligules 1-3.2 mm; blades to 31 cm long, 4-18 mm wide, flat, glabrous, with a few hairs behind the ligules. Panicles terminal, with 2-7 racemosely arranged branches; branches 2.2-7.9 cm, divergent to spreading, terminating in a spikelet; branch axes 1.1-2.3 mm wide, narrowly winged, glabrous, margins scabrous. Spikelets 2.8-3.6 mm long, 1.5-2 mm wide, paired, imbricate, appressed to divergent from the branch axes, elliptic to obovate, pubescent or glabrous, light brown to stramineous. Lower glumes absent; upper glumes and lower lemmas glabrous or sparsely pubescent, hairs shorter than 0.1 mm, 3-veined, margins entire; lower lemmas lacking ribs over the veins; upper florets stramineous. Caryopses 1.8-2 mm, golden brown or white. 2n = 60, ca. 64.</description>
