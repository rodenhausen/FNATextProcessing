Panicles 2-17 cm, with 5-23 racemose branches; branches 1-2.5(3.5) cm, stiff, often included in the upper leaf sheaths. Spikelets 4.5-7.5 mm, more or less imbricate, magenta or green, with 2-6 florets. Glumes triangular, acute; lower glumes 1.6-2 mm, acute; upper glumes 2-2.9 mm; lemmas 2.4-3.5 mm, ovate, membranous, sericeous along the lower veins, lateral veins pronounced, apices acute, obtuse, or truncate, awned, awns 0.5-1.5 mm; paleas minutely scabrous along the veins; anthers 3, 0.4-0.5 mm.

  <discussion>Leptochloa viscida is a Sonoran Desert species that occurs from southern California to southwestern New Mexico and south into adjacent Mexico. It differs from L. fusca subsp. fascicularis, which grows in the same region, in its consistently short-awned lemmas, smaller panicles, often prostrate and much-branched growth habit, and often reddish florets.</discussion>
