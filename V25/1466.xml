  <discussion>Paspalum nicorae is native to Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. It was introduced to the United States for use in pastures and as a cover crop in waterways. It is now established in the southeastern United States, growing as a weed in pastures, turf, and other disturbed areas.</discussion>
