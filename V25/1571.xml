  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; usually cespitose, sometimes rhizomatous. Culms 20-310 cm, erect, much-branched distally. Leaves not aromatic; ligules membranous, sometimes ciliate; blades linear, flat, folded, or convolute. Inflorescences terminal and axillary or a false panicle; inflorescence units 1-600+ per culm; peduncles initially concealed by the subtending leaf sheaths, sometimes exserted beyond the sheaths at maturity, with (1)2-5(13) rames; rames not reflexed at maturity, axes slender, terete to flattened, not longitudinally grooved, usually conspicuously pubescent, with spikelets in heterogamous sessile-pedicellate pairs (the terminal spikelets sometimes in triplets of 1 sessile and 2 pedicellate spikelets), apices of the internodes neither cupulate nor fimbriate; disarticulation in the rames, below the sessile spikelets. Sessile spikelets bisexual, awned, with short, blunt calluses; lower glumes 2-keeled, flat or concave, usually not veined between the keels, sometimes 2-9-veined; anthers 1, 3(2). Pedicels usually longer than 3 mm, similar to the rame internodes in shape, length, and pubescence color, not fused to the rame axes. Pedicellate spikelets usually vestigial or absent, sometimes well-developed and staminate. x = 10. </description>
  <discussion>Andropogon is a cosmopolitan genus of tropical and temperate zones, comprising approximately 120 species. Thirteen species are native to the Flora region. Andropogon bicornis has been found in the region but is not known to be established. All but A. hallii grow in the southeastern United States.
Several taxa are ecologically important in North America. Andropogon gerardii is one of the most important native grasses in North America, being one of the dominant species in the tall-grass prairies that used to cover the center of the continent. Many varieties of A. glomeratus and A. virginicus aggressively colonize abandoned fields, cutover timberlands, and roadsides. Some species are used in restoration and landscaping.
Species of Andropogon with solitary rames are easily confused with Schizachyrium but, in Andropogon, the lower glumes of the sessile spikelets are flat or concave and the rame internodes are not cupulate, whereas Schizachyrium has convex glumes and rame internodes with strongly cupulate apices. Successful identification of species in Andropogon sect. Leptopogon (numbers 3-14) requires mature, complete specimens and careful field study (Campbell 1983, 1986).
