  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; loosely cespitose, rhizomatous and stoloniferous. Culms 30-90 cm, erect or geniculate at the base. Sheaths open; auricles absent; abaxial ligules present, composed of a line of hairs across the collar; adaxial ligules membranous and sparsely ciliate, sometimes lacerate, cilia subequal to the base; blades flat, linear-lanceolate, resupinate, in living plants the glaucous-green adaxial surface facing downwards and the bright green abaxial surface facing upwards. Panicles not plumose. Spikelets pedicellate, somewhat laterally compressed, with 5-10 florets; rachilla segments conspicuously pilose; disarticulation at the base of the rachilla segment and below each spikelet. Glumes unequal, lanceolate, unawned; calluses 1.5-2 mm, strigose, hairs 1-1.5 mm; lemmas chartaceous, 3-veined, margins with papillose-based hairs near the base, apices inconspicuously bidentate, awned from between the teeth; awns 3-5 mm, straight; paleas 2-keeled. Caryopses glabrous, x = 10. </description>
  <discussion>Hakonechloa is a monotypic genus, endemic to Japan, but grown as an ornamental in the Flora region. The resupination of the blades is not evident on herbarium specimens.</discussion>
