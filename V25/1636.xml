  <discussion>Themeda triandra is native to India, Korea, China, and Japan. Many infraspecific taxa have been described in T. triandra and in T. australis, a species that is sometimes included in T. triandra. Themeda triandra subsp. japonica (Willd.) T. Koyama is sold as an ornamental in the Flora region but, in the absence of a treatment that covers both species throughout their range, it is impossible to state how it differs from other members of the complex.</discussion>
