  <description type="morphology">Plants cespitose. Culms 60-100 cm, sometimes reclining or decumbent, glabrous. Collars not elongate, about as wide as the blade; ligules to 0.5 mm, ciliolate; blades 5-15 cm long, 0.5-2 mm wide, involute or flat, glabrous or sparsely hairy basally, with a wide central zone of bulliform cells evident on the adaxial surfaces as a longitudinal stripe of white, spongy tissue. Rames 2-6 cm, eventually long-exserted; internodes 2-4 mm, straight, glabrous. Sessile spikelets 3.5-4.5 mm; calluses 0.5-1 mm, hairs to 1.2 mm; lower glumes glabrous; upper lemmas acute, entire; awns 6-10 mm. Pedicels 3-5 mm, glabrous. Pedicellate spikelets usually as long as or slightly longer than the sessile spikelets, sterile, unawned. 2n = 60.</description>
