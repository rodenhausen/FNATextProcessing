  <discussion>Panicum hirticaule subsp. sonorum has been collected only a few times. Its range extends from southern Arizona to Chiapas, Mexico. It may have originated through selection and cultivation. The Cocopa tribe of the extreme lower Colorado River region grow it for the seed, which is used for food.</discussion>
