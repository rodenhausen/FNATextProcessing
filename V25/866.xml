  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; synoecious; habit various, cespitose, stoloniferous, or rhizomatous. Culms 1-80 cm. Leaves usually mostly basal; sheaths open; ligules of hairs, membranous, or membranous and ciliate. Inflorescences terminal, panicles of 1-80 solitary, spikelike branches, exceeding the upper leaves; branches 4-50(75) mm, not woody, 1-sided, usually racemose on elongate rachises, sometimes digitate or subdigitate, with 1-130+ sessile to subsessile spikelets in 2 rows, axes terminating in a spikelet or extending beyond the base of the distal spikelet. Spikelets closely imbricate, appressed to pectinate, laterally compressed or terete, with 1-2(3) florets, lowest floret in each spikelet bisexual, distal florets staminate or sterile; disarticulation at the base of the branches or above the glumes. Glumes unequal or subequal, 1 or both glumes equaled or exceeded by the distal floret, 1-veined, acute or acuminate, sometimes shortly awned; lower glumes usually shorter than the lowest floret; lemmas of lowest florets entire, bilobed, trilobed, or 4-lobed, 3-veined, veins usually extended into 3 short awns; paleas of lowest florets 2-veined, veins sometimes excurrent; distal floret(s) staminate or sterile, varying from similar to the lowest floret in shape, size, and venation to sterile and reduced to an awn column with well-developed awns or to a flabellate scale, x = 10. </description>
  <discussion>Bouteloua, a genus of the Western Hemisphere with its center of diversity in Mexico, has about 40 species; all 19 species treated here are native to the Flora region. Several of its taxa are important forage grasses,  and  some  are important constituents  of the native North American grasslands. Two that are particularly important in North America are Bouteloua curtipendula and B. gracilis. These were major constituents of the shortgrass prairie that once covered the drier portions of the Great Plains. Both are excellent forage species. Irrigation has converted much of the area they once occupided to agricultural use, but large areas of Bouteloua grasslands remain.
Based on molecular data and morphological similarities in the non-pistillate characters, Columbus (1999) recommended expanding Bouteloua to include BuchloÃ«, Opizia, and Cathestecum, plus some other small genera not known from the Flora region. The traditional treatment is adopted here, pending corroboration from a wider range of data, both molecular and morphological.
