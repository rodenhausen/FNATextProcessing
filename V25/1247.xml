  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose, with numerous leaves clustered  at the base. Culms (10)50-140 cm, stout, stiffly erect, branched from the middle and lower nodes; lower nodes sericeous; lower internodes sericeous, hairs papillose-based, upper internodes sometimes glabrous. Sheaths rounded, glabrous or sparsely to densely hispid, hairs not fragile and prickly, not causing skin irritation, margins ciliate; ligules 1-3 mm; blades 3-60 cm long, 2-12 mm wide, flat or involute, ascending, adaxial surfaces densely hirsute basally, less densely so elsewhere, bases attenuate, apices acute. Panicles (4)15-40 cm long, (3)10-25 cm wide, about 1/3 â€“ 1/2 as long as the plants, open, breaking at the base of the peduncles at maturity and dispersed as tumbleweeds, secondary branching mostly confined to the distal 1/3 of the primary branches; rachises densely hispid or glabrous; lower primary branches in whorls of 4-7, stiffly spreading, naked on the lower 1/2; pedicels 3-20 mm, appressed. Spikelets 2-3 mm long, 0.8-1.2 mm wide, glabrous. Lower glumes 1-1.6 mm, 5-veined, acuminate; upper glumes and lower lemmas similar, 2-2.8 mm, 7-9-veined, exceeding the upper florets by about 0.3 mm; lower florets sterile; lower paleas 1.4-2.2 mm; upper florets 1.5-1.9 mm long, 0.7-1 mm wide, smooth, chestnut brown at maturity. 2n = 36.</description>
