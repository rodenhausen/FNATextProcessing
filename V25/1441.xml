  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; cespitose, rhizomatous, or stoloniferous. Culms 3-400 cm, erect, spreading or prostrate, sometimes trailing for 200+ cm. Sheaths open; auricles sometimes present; ligules membranous. Inflorescences terminal, sometimes also axillary, panicles of 1-many spikelike branches, these digitate or racemose on the rachis, spreading to erect, 1 or more branches completely or partially hidden in the sheaths in some species; branch axes flattened, usually narrowly to broadly winged, usually terminating in a spikelet, sometimes extending beyond the distal spikelet but never forming a distinct bristle; disarticulation below the glumes. Spikelets subsessile to shortly pedicellate, plano-convex, rounded to acuminate, dorsally compressed, not subtended by bristles or a ringlike callus, solitary or paired (1 spikelet of the pair reduced in some species), in 2 rows along 1 side of the branches, with 2 florets, first rachilla segment not swollen, upper glumes and upper lemmas adjacent to the branch axes; lower florets sterile; upper florets sessile or stipitate, bisexual, acute or rounded. Lower glumes absent or present only on some spikelets of each branch, without veins or 1-veined, unawned; upper glumes and lower lemmas subequal, membranous, apices rounded, unawned; lower paleas absent or rudimentary; upper lemmas convex, indurate, smooth to slightly rugose, stramineous to dark brown, margins scarious, involute, clasping the paleas; upper paleas indurate, smooth to slightly rugose, stramineous to dark brown. Caryopses orbicular to elliptical, plano-convex or flattened, white, yellow, or brown, x = 10, 12. </description>
  <discussion>Paspalum includes 300-400 species, most of which are native to the Western Hemisphere. Forty-three species are found in the Flora region; twenty-four are native. Paspalum scrobiculatum is grown as a grain in India, and several species are grown as forage plants. There are also many weedy species in the genus. Nineteen of the species growing in the Flora region are introduced, and some of them are weedy. Because weeds are under-represented in most herbaria, the distribution maps of such species probably understate their prevalence.</discussion>
