  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or short-lived perennials. Culms 10-70 cm, decumbent, branching and rooting at the lower nodes; nodes glabrous; internodes glabrous or sparsely pilose distally. Sheaths mostly pubescent or glabrous, margins ciliate; ligules 0.5-1.3 mm; blades 2-15(27) cm long, 3-10 (12) mm wide, glabrous or pubescent; margins scabrous, sometimes ciliate basally; bases subcordate, not clasping the stems. Panicles 2.5-13(22) cm, with 3-6(9) spikelike primary branches in 2 ranks; primary branches 2-7 cm, ascending to reflexed, axes 0.7-1.2 mm wide, flat and narrowly winged, margins scabrous; secondary branches absent; pedicels shorter than the spikelets, scabrous. Spikelets 3.3-3.8 mm long, 1-1.4 mm wide, solitary, appressed to the branches, in 2 rows. Glumes separated by 0.3-0.5 mm; lower glumes 1.4-1.7 mm, 1/3 – 1/2 as long as the spikelets, 9-11-veined, glabrous; upper glumes 2.7-3.4 mm, glabrous, 7-9-veined; lower florets sterile; lower lemmas 2.7-3.4 mm, glabrous, 5-veined, without evident cross venation; lower paleas present; upper lemmas 2.6-3.4 mm, apices rounded to acute, mucronate; anthers 1.1-1.35 mm. Caryopses 1.6-2.5 mm. 2n = 36, 54, 72, 84.</description>
