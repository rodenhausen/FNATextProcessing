  <description type="morphology">Zea mays subsp. huehuetenangensis is morphologically similar to subsp. parviglumis (see below), but it often grows more than 5 m tall, and has essentially glabrous leaves, and smaller staminate panicles with fewer (less than 40), firmer branches, and different ecological, phenological, and molecular characteristics.</description>
  <discussion>It is endemic to the Province of Huehuetenango, Guatemala, where it grows as a common weed on the edges of, and in, maize fields, and in seasonally moist oak cloud and tropical deciduous forests, at elevations from 900-1650 m. In its native range, it commonly hybridizes with Z. mays subsp. mays, both subspecies flowering from mid-December to mid-January, at the end of the wet season.</discussion>
