  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial, if perennial, growth habit various. Culms erect or decumbent, someÂ¬times succulent or robust. Ligules membranous, membranous and ciliate, or lacerate; blades with the vascular bundles surrounded by 2 thick-walled sheaths, outer sheaths parenchymatous, chloroplasts few and unspecialized or absent. Photosynthesis C3. Spikelets ovoid, ellipsoid, or obovoid, glabrous, pilose, or tuberculate. Lower glumes 1/5 - 4/5 as long as the spikelets, usually 3-veined; upper glumes and lower lemmas usually 5-veined (rarely 7- or 9-veined); lower florets sterile or staminate; lower paleas present or absent; upper florets sometimes stipitate, indurate to membranous, smooth and shiny, or rugose, or finely pubescent, or with paired glands, x = 9 or 10, with some polyploids.</description>
