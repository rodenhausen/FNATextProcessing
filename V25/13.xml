  <description type="morphology">The PACCAD group of grasses consists of the Panicoideae, Arundinoideae sensu stricto, Chloridoideae, Centothecoxideae, Aristidoideae, and Danthonioideae. It includes more than half the species in the Poaceae as a whole and, according to every molecular study, constitutes a monophyletic group. There is not, however, any obvious morphological character that dis-tinguishes it from other taxa or groups of taxa. Two characteristics that all its members share, so far as is known, are embryos with an elongated mesocotyl internode and lodicules that lack a distal membranous portion, but neither of these features is useful for routine identification.</description>
  <discussion>Despite the lack of an obvious morphological character for recognizing PACCAD grasses, some general statements can be made. All C4 grasses are in the PACCAD group, but so are many C3 grasses. Perhaps because such a high proportion of the PACCAD grasses employ a C4 photo-synthetic pathway, the group is associated with warm climates and/or late summer blooming. Solid culms are common, but not universal, among PACCAD species; consequently a solid culm is a good indication that a grass belongs to one of the PACCAD subfamilies, but a hollow culm provides no information. Many PACCAD species have punctate hila, but so do many of the non-PACCAD grasses. It is generally easier to place a grass in its tribe or subfamily and from that determine whether it is a PACCAD grass than to work in the other direction.
Within the PACCAD grasses, molecular data indicate that Panicoideae and Centothecoideae are sister taxa, as are the two pairs Arundinoideae + Chloridoideae and Aristidoideae + Danthonioideae. The last four subfamilies form a group that members of the Grass Phylogeny Working Group (2000, 2001) refer to as the "Ligule of Hairs clade" because many (but not all) of its members have ligules made up of a fringe of hairs. Other, more cryptic characteristics shared by members of the four subfamilies are the presence of compound starch grains in the endosperm and embryonic leaf margins that meet rather than overlap.

    <key_discussion>The following key to tribes includes only tribes in the PACCAD subfamilies. It is based primarily on morphological characters that can be observed with a hand lens, but many of the characters that delimit the tribes are microscopic or molecular. For this reason, several tribes have had to be keyed out more than once. A key to all tribes of grasses represented in the Flora region will be presented in Volume 24 of the Flora, as will as an artificial key to the genera.</key_discussion>

2. Spikelets usually dorsally compressed, sometimes terete, rarely laterally compressed; sexually functional spikelets with 2 dimorphic florets (rarely only 1 floret), the lower floret sterile or staminate, the upper floret bisexual or unisexual; upper glumes markedly different in texture from the upper lemmas, the thicker of the 2 structures coriaceous to indurate, rarely merely membranous, the thinner structure hyaline to membranous (Panicoideae, in part).
3. Glumes membranous, thinner than the upper lemmas; lower glumes usually shorter
than the upper glumes, sometimes missing; upper glumes varying from slightly shorter
to slightly longer than the upper lemmas; upper lemmas well-developed, usually
indurate to coriaceous (sometimes membranous); lower lemmas similar in texture to
the upper glumes; all spikelets pedicellate, often shortly so; inflorescence branches
remaining intact at maturity.....25. Paniceae
3. Glumes indurate, thicker than the lemmas, often subequal, at least 1 and usually both
exceeding the florets; all lemmas hyaline; spikelets usually in pairs, sometimes in triplets,
sometimes apparently solitary and sessile, 1 spikelet in each pair or triplet usually sessile,
sometimes all spikelets pedicellate; inflorescence branches often breaking up at maturity .....26. Andropogoneae
2. Spikelets usually laterally compressed, sometimes terete; spikelets with other than 2 florets or, if with 2, the sex distribution usually not as in the Paniceae or Andropogoneae; upper lemmas (if more than 1 floret present) usually as thick as or thicker than the upper glumes, usually membranous to coriaceous, rarely indurate.
