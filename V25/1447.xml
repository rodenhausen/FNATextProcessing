Panicles terminal, usually composed of a pair of branches, a third branch sometimes present below the terminal pair; branches 2.5-12.7 cm, diverging to spreading, often arcuate, persistent; branch axes 0.2-0.8 mm wide, glabrous, margins scabrous, terminating in a reduced spikelet. Spikelets 1.3-1.9 mm long, 0.8-1.1 mm wide, solitary, appressed to the branch axes, ovate, stramineous. Lower glumes absent; upper glumes pilose on the margins, veinless or 2-3-veined; lower lemmas glabrous, veinless or 2-3-veined; upper florets whitish to golden yellow.
