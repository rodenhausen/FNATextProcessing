  <discussion>Erioneuron avenaceum is common in rocky areas from the southwestern United States to central Mexico; it also grows in Bolivia and Argentina. North American plants belong to E. avenaceum (Kunth) Tateoka var. avenaceum. Stoloniferous plants occur in the Flora region, but they are most common in central Mexico.</discussion>
