  <description type="morphology">Plants cespitose, conspicuously hairy, grayish. Culms 5-15(25) cm, usually ascending to erect, occasionally     spreading and forming mats. Leaves usually without a "collar" line; blades 1-4 cm long,  2-4  mm wide. Spikes 2-3.5(5) cm, more or less capitate, usually densely congested; lower and upper internodes 1-4 mm. Spikelets with 4-20(30) florets. Glumes subequal, about 3 mm, irregularly toothed; lemmas 4-5 mm, teeth about 1/2 as long as the lemma, central tooth conspicuously longer than the others, teeth sharp, if awn-tipped, awns less than 0.5 mm; paleas about equal to the lemmas; anthers about 2 mm. Caryopses 1.3-1.5 mm, broadly elliptical; embryos about as long as the caryopses. 2n = 24.</description>
