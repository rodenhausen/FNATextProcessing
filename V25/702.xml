  <discussion>Calamovilfa longifolia usually grows in sand or sandy soils, but is occasionally found in clay soils or loess. Two geographically contiguous varieties exist. They differ as shown in the following key; the differences between the two are more striking in the field.</discussion>
  <key>
    <key_body>
1. Most spikelets overlapping no more than 1 other spikelet, usually with a brownish cast  ..... var. magna
1. Most spikelets overlapping 2-3 other spikelets, usually without a brownish cast   .....var. longifolia
