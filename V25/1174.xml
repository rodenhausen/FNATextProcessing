  <description type="morphology">Plants cespitose, with caudices or knotty crowns. Basal rosettes well-differentiated. Culms 18-100 cm, decumbent to erect, usually glabrous; nodes bearded or glabrous; fall phase often much branched and rebranched, with smaller blades and panicles than those of the culms. Cauline leaves 3-7; sheaths usually glabrous, lower sheaths sometimes pilose; ligules 0.2-0.8 mm, of hairs, or absent. Primary panicles exserted. Spikelets ellipsoid to obovoid, glabrous or pubescent. Upper florets acute to obtuse.</description>
  <discussion>Gene exchange between the subspecies of Dichanthelium dichotomum, and between D. dichotomum and other species in the genus, appears to be rather common.</discussion>
