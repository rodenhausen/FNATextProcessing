  <discussion>Tridens ambiguus grows on the southeastern coastal plain, from North Carolina to Texas. It is usually found in mesic to perennially moist soils of pine flatwoods and pine-oak savannahs, in seasonally inundated depresÂ¬sions, and at the margins of pitcher plant bogs, often in disturbed sites.</discussion>
