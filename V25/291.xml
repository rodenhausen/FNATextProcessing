Spikelets 3.5-7 mm, yellowish to pale greenish. Glumes (3)3.5-6(7) mm, scabridulous, unawned or awn-tipped; lower glumes shorter than the upper glumes, 1-veined; upper glumes equaling or exceeding the florets, 3-veined, acuminate to acute, occasionally 3-toothed, awned, awns to 1.5 mm; lemmas 3.5-5.5(6) mm, lanceolate, pubescent on the lower 1/2 of the midveins and margins, hairs to 1 mm, apices scabrous, acuminate, awned, awns 12-27 mm, flexuous; paleas 3.5-5.5 mm, lanceolate, pilose between the veins, apices scabridulous, acuminate; anthers 2-3.5 mm, purple.
