  <description type="morphology">Plants annual; viscid-aromatic, pilose, sometimes sparsely so, producing long, juvenile, floating basal leaves. Culms 3-35 cm, erect, ascending, or decumbent, sometimes becoming prostrate, not breaking apart at the nodes, usually branching only at the lower nodes. Leaves without ligules, sometimes with a "collar" line visible at the junction of the sheath and blade, especially when dry; blades flat or becoming involute in drying. Inflorescences terminal, clavate to capitate spikes, exserted at maturity, spikelets distichously arranged; disarticulation tardy, above the glumes and between the florets. Spikelets laterally compressed, with 4-40 florets. Glumes irregularly 2-5-toothed; lemmas deeply cleft and strongly 5-veined, veins terminating in prominent mucronate or awn-tipped teeth 1/3 - 1/2 or more as long as the lemma bodies, each tooth with an additional weaker vein on either side of a strong central vein, these extending about halfway to the base of the lemma; paleas well-developed, 2-veined; lodicules absent; anthers 3, white or pinkish, exserted on long, slender, ribbonlike filaments at anthesis; styles 2, apical, elongate, filiform, stigmatic for 1/3 â€“ 1/2  of their length; stigmatic hairs short, often sparse. Caryopses slightly compressed laterally, oblong to elliptic; embryos 3/4 as long as to equaling the caryopses; epiblast absent, x = 10, probably. </description>
  <discussion>Orcuttia is a genus of five species, all of which are restricted to vernal pools and similar habitats in California and northern Baja California, Mexico.</discussion>
