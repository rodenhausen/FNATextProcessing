  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Plants very similar in most respects to subsp. microcarpon. Fall phase freely branching from all nodes, reclining from masses of branchlets and numerous reduced, ciliate blades and secondary panicles. Cauline sheaths and blades usually glabrous, lower sheaths and blades sometimes sparsely pubescent. Spikelets 1.8-2.5 mm (rarely longer), puberulent or pubescent. Lower glumes less than 1/3 as long as the spikelets, subacute; upper glumes and lower lemmas subequal; upper florets 1.7-2 mm long, 0.7-1.0 mm wide, subobtuse. 2n = unknown.</description>
  <discussion>Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. nitidum grows in moist to wet areas, and the borders of swamps. It is primarily a coastal plain taxon, ranging from Virginia to southeastern Texas and Florida.
Dichanthelium dichotomum subsp. nitidum is very similar to both subsp. microcarpon and subsp. mattamuskeetense, and intergrades with each occasionally.
