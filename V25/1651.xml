  <discussion>Rottboellia cochinchinensis is a native of southeast Asia. The species is considered one of the world's worst weeds, and is classified as a noxious weed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is established in the southeastern United States, and has been reported from scattered locations elsewhere in the contiguous United States. In Africa, it is controlled by tillage or by fire, followed by shallow, then deep, plowing (Hall and Patterson 1992). 'Itchgrass' aptly describes the effects of the hairs on the skin.</discussion>
