  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose, not rhizomatous, occasionally purple-tinged throughout, mostly glabrous throughout (except as noted). Culms 35-150 cm, stout, compressed. Sheaths more or less strongly compressed or keeled, sides usually glabrous or sparsely pubescent distally; ligules 0.3-3 mm, membranous, erose or ciliate, cilia often themselves fimbriate; blades 8-50 cm long, 2-12 mm wide, flat or folded, both surfaces usually glabrous or scabridulous, or the adaxial surfaces sparsely pilose basally. Panicles terminal and axillary, 9-40 cm, 1/3 – 3/4 as wide as long, usually dense; ultimate branchlets usually appressed, 1-sided, scabridulous; pedicels 0.5-1.5 mm, usually appressed, sometimes with 1-several slender hairs at the apices. Spikelets usually 1.6-3.8 mm, usually subsessile, lanceolate, green, purple-tinged, or purple, glabrous. Lower glumes 2/5 – 3/4 as long as the spikelets, 3-veined, midveins keeled; upper glumes and lower lemmas subequal or the glumes slightly longer, often spreading slightly apart at the apices, midveins keeled, usually scabridulous apically; lower florets sterile; lower paleas to 2/3 as long as the lower lemmas; upper florets 1.4-2 mm long, 0.6-0.8 mm wide, 2/5 – 3/4 as long as the spikelets, occasionally stipitate, lustrous, with a tuft of minute, thickish hairs at the apices; upper lemmas thick, stiff, clasping the upper paleas throughout their length. 2n =18.</description>
  <discussion>Panicum rigidulum grows in swamps, wet woodlands, flood-plain forests, wet pine savannahs, marshy shores of rivers, ponds, and lakes, drainage ditches, and other similar wet to moist places; it is rarely found in dry sites. Its range extends from southern Canada to Mexico, Guatemala, and the Antilles.</discussion>
