Spikelets 3-3.5 mm. Lower glumes 1/2 as long as the spikelets, 3-veined; upper glumes 2/3 as long as the spikelets, 5-7-veined; lower lemmas equaling the upper lemmas, 5-veined; lower paleas absent or reduced to a small scale; upper lemmas about 3 mm, nearly smooth, shiny. 2n = 54.</description>
  <discussion>Setaria megaphylla is a species of tropical Africa and tropical America that has become established in Florida. Hitchcock (1951) stated that S. poiretiana (Schult.) Kunth was occasionally cultivated in the United States, but he was referring to S. megaphylla.</discussion>
