  <description type="morphology">Culms 20-120 cm. Panicles more than twice as long as wide, relatively contracted, usually nodding, not fully exerted; branches ascending to appressed; pulvini almost absent. Upper florets stramineous to orange, not disarticulating at maturity.</description>
  <discussion>Panicum miliaceum subsp. miliaceum is the subÂ¬species used in bird seed. It probably rarely persists because of the retention of the upper florets on the plant and, in northern states, poor seed survival over winter.</discussion>
