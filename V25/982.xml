  <discussion>See subfamily description.
The tribe Aristideae has three genera and 300-350 species, and is primarily pan-tropical in its distribution. Its members are usually readily recognized by their terete, 3-awned lemmas with overlapping margins. Aristida, which has many more species than the other two genera combined, is the only genus found in the Americas.
