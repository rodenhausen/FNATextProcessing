  <description type="morphology">Plants annual, perennial, or of indefinite duration. Culms 5-250 cm, erect or decumbent, branching basally or at aerial culm nodes, when annual or of indefinite duration usually decumbent and rooting at the lower nodes. Sheaths open; ligules membranous, sometimes ciliate; blades usually flat. Inflorescences terminal, sometimes also axillary, usually panicles of 1-sided spikelike branches (sometimes only 1 branch) attached digitately or racemosely to a rachis, sometimes simple panicles of solitary, pedicellate spikelets; spikelike branches, if present, sometimes with secondary branches, primary branch axes triquetrous, bearing spikelets abaxially, in 2 rows, usually in unequally pedicellate groups of 2-5, occasionally borne singly. Spikelets 1.2-8.2 mm, lanceoloid to ellipsoid, dorsally compressed, apices obtuse to acuminate, unawned, with 2 florets; disarticulation beneath the glumes. Lower glumes absent or to 1/4 as long as the spikelets; upper glumes usually from 1/6 as long as to equaling the spikelets, occasionally absent, 0-5-veined, usually pubescent; lower florets sterile; lower lemmas membranous, usually as long as the upper lemmas, usually pubescent, (3)5-7(13)-veined; lower paleas absent or reduced; upper lemmas mostly stiffly chartaceous to cartilaginous, obscurely veined, with 0.5-1 mm hyaline margins that embrace the upper paleas; upper paleas similar to the upper lemmas in texture and size; lodicules 3, cuneate; anthers 3. Caryopses plano-convex; embryos 1/5â€“1/2 as long as the caryopses; hila punctiform to ellipsoid, x = 9. </description>
  <discussion>Digitaria has approximately 200 species and grows primarily in tropical and warm-temperate regions, often in disturbed, open sites. Some species are grown as cereals; others for forage or as lawn grasses. In North America, the genus is best known for two of its weedy species, D. sanguinalis and D. ciliaris. There are 29 species known to occur in the Flora region; 18 are native to the region.
Most annual species of Digitaria will survive several years in regions without a pronounced cold season; such species are described as being of indefinite duration.</discussion>
