Panicles 18-35 cm long, 10-30 cm wide, broadly ovate, open; primary branches 3-18 cm, diverging 10-90° from the rachises, stiff, viscid, naked basally; pulvini hairy, hairs to 6 mm; pedicels 0.2-1.2 mm, appressed. Spikelets 3.5-6(7.6) mm long, 1-1.5 mm wide, linear-lanceolate, stramineous to reddish-purple, with 4-10 florets; disarticulation basipetal, glumes persistent.
