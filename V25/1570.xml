  <discussion>Reed (1964) reported finding Apluda mutica on chrome ore piles in Canton, Maryland (a temporary unloading ground for ores). The report has not been verified because his voucher specimens were not accessible at the time of writing. They were acquired by the Missouri Botanical Garden in 2001.</discussion>
