Panicles 2-6(6.8) cm; rachis internodes 2-4 mm; fascicles 5-13 mm long, 2-4 mm wide, not imbricate, ovoid, glabrous; outer bristles sometimes present, flattened; inner bristles less than 30, 3.2-6 mm long, 0.2-1 mm wide at the base, in more than 1 whorl, fused for at least 1/2 their length into a distinct cupule, diverging at irregular intervals from the cupule, somewhat flattened, spreading, purple-tipped at maturity. Spikelets 1-3 per fascicle, 4-7 mm. Lower glumes 1.4-3.1 mm; upper glumes 3.2-5.4 mm, 3-5-veined; upper lemmas 4-6 mm, 3-5-veined; upper florets 3.9-6.5 mm; anthers 0.9-1.9 mm.
