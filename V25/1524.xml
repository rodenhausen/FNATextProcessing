Leaves cauline, often purplish; sheaths keeled, pubescent basally and sometimes sparsely so distally, margins ciliate; ligules 0.2-0.5 mm, truncate; blades 0.5-7 cm long, 1-7 mm wide, flat, pubescent. Rames 2-3 cm; internodes 2-3 mm, flat, ciliate on the edges and distally. Sessile spikelets 3-4 mm, ovate, pilose, brown or yellow-brown; calluses blunt; glumes concealing the floret; lower glumes 2-3 mm; lemmas about 1 mm; awns 4-12 mm, exserted, geniculate, twisted below the bend, brown.
