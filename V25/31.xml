  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; rhizomatous. Culms to 2.5 m. Sheaths glabrate, mostly glabrous at maturity, with tufts of hairs near the collar; collars ciliate to pubescent; blades to 67 cm long, about 1 cm wide. Panicles 27-67 cm, open; branches drooping or nodding at maturity.  Spikelets 15-30(50) mm long, 6-16 mm wide, ovate-elliptical, with (3)5-34 florets, the lower (3)4-5(8) sterile. Glumes 5-12 mm, acute; lemmas essentially glabrous, (7)9(13)-veined; paleas present only in the functional florets; anthers 4-6 mm. Caryopses 3-5 mm long, 1-1.5 mm wide. 2n = 40. </description>
