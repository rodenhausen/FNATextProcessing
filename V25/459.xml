  <discussion>Many of the Zoysia lawn grasses grown in the southern and eastern United States are derived from hybrids between Z. matrella and Z. pacifica or Z. japonica, and have retained many of the characteristics of Z. matrella. They are used as lawn grasses from Connecticut southwards, and have occasionally been found as escapes in that region.</discussion>
