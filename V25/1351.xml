  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; habit various. Culms 3-800 cm, not woody, sometimes branching above the base; internodes solid or hollow. Ligules membranous and ciliate, or of hairs, rarely completely membranous; blades sometimes pseudopetiolate. Inflorescences spicate panicles with highly reduced branches termed fascicles; panicles 1-many per plant, terminal on the culms or on both the culms and the secondary branches, or terminal and axillary, or only axillary, usually completely exposed at maturity; rachises usually terete, with (l)5-many fascicles; fascicle axes 0.2-7.5(28) mm, with (1)3-130+ bristles and 1-12 spikelets. Bristles free or fused at the base, disarticulating with the spikelets at maturity; of 3 kinds, outer, inner, and primary, in some species with all 3 kinds present below each spikelet, in others 1 or more kinds missing from some or all of the spikelets; outer (lower) bristles antrorsely scabrous, terete; inner (upper) bristles antrorsely scabrous or long-ciliate, usually flatter and wider than the outer bristles; primary (terminal) bristles located immediately below the spikelets, solitary, antrorsely scabrous or long-ciliate, often longer than the other bristles associated with the spikelet; disarticulation usually at the base of the fascicles, sometimes also beneath the upper florets. Spikelets with 2 florets; lower glumes absent or present, 0-5-veined; upper glumes longer, 0-11-veined; lower florets sterile or staminate; lower lemmas usually as long as the spikelets, membranous, 3-15-veined, margins usually glabrous; lower paleas present or absent; upper lemmas membranous to coriaceous, 5-12-veined; upper paleas shorter than the lemmas but similar in texture; lodicules 0 or 2, glabrous; anthers 3, if present, x = 5,7, 8,9 (usually 9). </description>
  <discussion>Pennisetum has 80-130 species, most of which grow in the tropics and subtropics, and occupy a wide range of habitats. Twenty-five species are native to the Western Hemisphere, but none to the Flora region. Most of the species treated here are cultivated for food, forage, or as ornamental plants. Many species, including several cultivated species, are weedy. Four are classified as noxious weeds by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Records known to be based on cultivated plants are not included in the distribution maps but, in many cases, it is not possible to determine whether a record is based on a cultivated plant or an escape.
The placement of the boundary between Pennisetum and Cenchrus is contentious. As treated here, Pennisetum has antrorsely scabrous bristles that are not spiny, fascicle axes that terminate in a bristle, and chromosome base numbers of 5, 7, 8, and 9. Cenchrus has retrorsely (rarely antrorsely) scabrous, spiny bristles, fascicle axes that are terminated by a spikelet, and a chromosome base number of 17 (Wipff 2001). In both genera, the bristles are reduced branches (Goebel 1882; Sohns 1955).

    <key_discussion>NOTE: Pedicel length is the distance from the base of the primary bristles to the base of the terminal spikelets. Fascicle axis lengths and fascicle densities are measured in the middle of the panicle; spikelet measurements refer to the largest spikelets in the fascicles.</key_discussion>
