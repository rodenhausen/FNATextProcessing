  <discussion>Miscanthus oligostachyus is a native of Japanese and Korean forests that is sold as an ornamental species in the United States. It does best in regions with cool summers. Koyama (1987) recognized three subspecies of M. oligostachyus; they have not been evaluated for this treatment.</discussion>
