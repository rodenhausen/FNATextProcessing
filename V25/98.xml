Spikelets appressed, in 2 rows along 1 side of the rachises, with 3-20 bisexual florets, distal florets sterile or staminate; disarticulation above the glumes and between the florets. Glumes unequal, l(3)-veined; lemmas 1-3-veined, backs slightly keeled or rounded, apices lobed or bifid, mucronate or awned from between the lobes, lateral veins sometimes also excurrent, awns usually straight; anthers 1-3. x = 10. </description>
