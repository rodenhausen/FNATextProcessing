  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; rhizomatous, not rooting at the lower nodes. Culms 50-80 cm, erect. Sheaths glabrous, pubescent apically, margins scarious; ligules 1-2 mm, membranous, lacerate; blades 3-4 mm wide, flat, glabrous, pubescent behind the ligules, margins papillose-ciliate. Inflorescence terminal, erect, a spicate raceme 7-15 cm long, or a panicle with 1-2 subterminal spicate branches that are wholly or partially enclosed in the upper sheath, often arcuate; branches terminating in a spikelet. Spikelets 2.7-3 mm, paired, imbricate, obovate, stramineous. Lower glumes absent, or 1-2.3 mm; upper glumes and lower lemmas glabrous, 3-veined, margins entire; lower lemma lacking ribs over the veins; lower florets often staminate; lower paleas 2.5-2.9 mm, membranous; upper florets 2.3-2.9 mm, white, stramineous, or golden brown. 2n = 40.</description>
