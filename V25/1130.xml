  <description type="morphology">Plants usually cespitose, sometimes with knotty rhizomes; basal rosettes absent. Culms initially erect, ultimately decumbent, often with hard, cormlike bases; fall phase freely divaricate-branching before the primary panicles mature. Cauline leaves 4-14; sheaths glabrous or pubescent, not viscid; ligules membranous and ciliate or of hairs; blades with papillose-based marginal cilia. Primary panicles exserted. Spikelets obovoid to obpyriform, with papillose-based hairs, attenuate basally. Upper florets with pointed to attenuate, puberulent apices.</description>
