  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose, shortly rhizomatous and often stoloniferous. Culms 20-150 cm, erect or decumbent, flattened, glabrous; internodes hollow. Leaves basal and cauline; sheaths open, keeled, strongly compressed, distinctly distichous, equitant; ligules to 0.5 mm, scarious, densely short ciliate; blades flat or folded, erect to spreading, both surfaces usually glabrous, sometimes scabrous or scabridulous. Inflorescences terminal, exceeding the upper leaves, panicles of 1-36 non-disarticulating spikelike branches; branches digitately arranged, axes triquetrous, with spikelets in 2 rows on the abaxial sides of the branches. Spikelets solitary, diverging strongly from the branch axes, laterally compressed, sessile or subsessile, with 2-3 florets; lowest florets bisexual; second florets usually reduced to a stipitate empty lemma, occasionally with a palea, staminate if a third floret is present; third florets, if present, sterile and usually rudimentary, stipitate; disarticulation above the glumes. Glumes unequal, 1-veined; lower glumes somewhat smaller than the upper glumes, narrow, acuminate; upper glumes almost as long as the spikelets, flattened, scarious, glabrous, green, pale, or purplish, veins antrorsely scabrous, apices truncate, bilobed, or bifid, often mucronate; lowest lemmas cartilaginous, light to dark brown, scabridulous distally, 3-veined, unawned, mucronate, or with a single awn, awns to 1.2 mm; paleas equaling or slightly shorter than the lemmas, glabrous, 2-veined, veins keeled, shortly ciliate or scabridulous; anthers 3, deep purple to purple-red. Caryopses 1-1.7 mm, trigonous-ellipsoid, glabrous, translucent when fresh, pale to slightly reddish-purple-tinged, x = 10. </description>
  <discussion>Eustachys, as treated here, is a genus of approximately 12 species, most of which are native to the Western Hemisphere; four are native to the Flora region and three have been introduced. It is, in many ways, morphologically similar to Chloris, with the placement of a few species being problematic. Molecular data (Alice et al. 2000) support its recognition as a distinct genus, but the relationships between it, Chloris sensu stricto, and Cynodon are not clear.</discussion>
