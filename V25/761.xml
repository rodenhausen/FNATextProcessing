  <discussion>Muhlenbergia crispiseta grows on rock outcrops, in rocky drainages, and on white tablelands, on soils derived from calcareous parent materials in pine-oak and pinyon-juniper woodlands, at elevations of 1900-2600 m. It is basically a Mexican species, with a disjunct population in Brewster County, Texas.</discussion>
