  <discussion>Hyparrhenia hirta is native to southern Africa, where it grows on stony soils and is sometimes used for thatching. It has been cultivated in Texas and Florida, but is not currently known to be established in the Flora region. A report of its occurrence in Los Angeles County, California, has not been verified.</discussion>
