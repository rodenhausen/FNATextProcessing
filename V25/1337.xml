  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; cespitose and rhizomatous. Culms 50-250 cm, erect, not rooting at the lower nodes; internodes glabrous; nodes 3-7, puberulent to appressed pilose, rarely glabrous. Sheaths glabrous; collars hairy; ligules 0.5-1.5 mm; blades 10-60 cm long, 5-15 mm wide, linear, flat to conduplicate, straight or lax, spreading, glabrous adaxially. Panicles 10-30 cm long, 2.5-10 cm wide, open or contracted; rachises villous or puberulent; branches 10-25, 15-60 mm long, 0.5-0.8 mm wide, appressed to spreading, villous to shortly pilose, rarely puberulent or scabrous, not winged, with 16-40 spikelets on the primary branches, spikelets in unequally pedicellate pairs or triplets proximally, solitary distally; pedicels 0.3-2.5 mm, variously hirsute below, with fewer than 10 hairs more than 0.5 mm long at the apices. Spikelets 3.7-5.7 mm long, 1.3-1.8 mm wide, ovate to elliptic. Upper glumes equaling the lower lemmas, ovate, hairy, 5-veined, acute, unawned, rarely mucronate; lower lemmas 3.5-5 mm long, 1.3-1.8 mm wide, ovate to elliptic, setose, 5(7)-veined, acute, unawned; lower paleas fully developed, as long as or longer than the lemmas, hyaline; anthers 3 or absent; upper lemmas 3.1-4.6 mm, indurate, elliptic, 5-veined, acute to rounded, mucronate or awned, awns 0.1-0.6 mm; upper paleas 3-4.3 mm, indurate, blunt. 2n = 36.</description>
