  <discussion>Coix lacryma-jobi is a tall, maize-like plant. In North America, it is usually grown as an ornamental, but it has become established at scattered locations in the Flora region. The involucres, which can be used as beads, may be white, blue, pink, straw, gray, brown, or black, with the color being distributed evenly, irregularly, or in stripes. Cultivars with easily removed involucres are grown for food and beverage, especially in Asia.</discussion>
