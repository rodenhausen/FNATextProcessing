Panicles terminal, with 2-7 racemosely arranged branches; branches 1.5-12 cm, racemose, divergent; branch axes 0.7-1.4 mm wide, winged, glabrous, margins scabrous, terminating in a spikelet. Spikelets 2.3-4 mm long, 1.7-2.5 mm wide, paired, appressed to the branch axes, ovate, tapering to an acute apex, stramineous (rarely purple). Lower glumes absent; upper glumes and lower lemmas 5-7-veined, margins pilose; upper florets stramineous. Caryopses 2-2.3 mm, white to brown. 2n = 20, 40, 50-63.</description>
  <discussion>Paspalum dilatatum is native to Brazil and Argentina. It is now well established in the Flora region, generally as a weed in waste places. It is also used as a turf grass.</discussion>
