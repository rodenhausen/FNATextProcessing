  <discussion>In the Western Hemisphere, D. eriantha subsp. pentzii has traditionally been referred to as D. decumbens Stent. It is widely cultivated as a forage grass throughout the tropics at low and intermediate altitudes (up to 2000 m). It does not set seed; propagation is by sprigging the stolons.</discussion>
