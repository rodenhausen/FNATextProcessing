  <discussion>Aristida floridana grows in waste places, along road-sides, and on railroad embankments. It is rare in the United States, being known only from Key West and Ramrod Key, Florida. It is more common in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, where it intergrades with Aristida ternipes.</discussion>
