  <description type="morphology">Plants cespitose, with knotty, shortly rhizomatous bases. Culms 20-75 cm, slender, strictly erect; nodes glabrous; internodes often pilose. Sheaths mostly glabrous or pilose throughout, collar and distal portion of the margins densely pilose; ligules to 0.5 mm, membranous, ciliate; blades 1-3(5) mm wide, flat or becoming inrolled, hispid, with long hairs on the adaxial surface just above the ligule, apices attenuate. Panicles 5-16 cm long, 2-9 cm wide, open or loosely contracted; branches (2)4-7 cm, slender, lax, strongly divergent to drooping, basal portion naked, spikelets confined to the distal portion; pedicels (2)3-6 mm. Spikelets 6-13 mm, with 6-12 florets. Glumes glabrous, 1-veined; lower glumes 3 mm; upper glumes 3.5-4 mm, bright green; lemmas 3-4.5 mm, usually purple or rosy-purple at maturity, beins pilose to midlength, lateral veins often excurrent as short points; paleas 3-3.5 mm, glabrous, abruptly broadened and bowed-out below; anthers 1-1.5 mm. Caryopses 1.5-2 mm. 2n = 40.</description>
