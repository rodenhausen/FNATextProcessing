  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; usually synoecious, sometimes dioecious; cespitose, stoloniferous, or rhizomatous. Culms 2-160 cm, not woody, erect, decumbent, or geniculate, sometimes rooting at the lower nodes, simple or branched; internodes solid or hollow. Leaves not strongly distichous; sheaths open, often with tufts of hairs at the apices, hairs 0.3-8 mm; ligules usually membranous and ciliolate or ciliate, cilia sometimes longer than the membranous base, occasionally of hairs or membranous and non-ciliate; blades flat, folded, or involute. Inflorescences terminal, sometimes also axillary, simple panicles, open to contracted or spike¬like, terminal panicles usually exceeding the upper leaves; pulvini in the axils of the primary branches glabrous or not; branches not spikelike, not disarticulating. Spikelets 1-27 mm long, 0.5-9 mm wide, laterally compressed, with (1)2-60 florets; disarticulation below the fertile florets, sometimes also below the glumes, acropetal with deciduous glumes and lemmas but persistent paleas, or basipetal with the glumes often persistent and the florets usually falling intact. Glumes usually shorter than the adjacent lemmas, l(3)-veined, not lobed, apices obtuse to acute, unawned; calluses glabrous or sparsely pubescent; lemmas usually glabrous, obtuse to acute, (l)3(5)-veined, usually keeled, unawned or mucronate; paleas shorter than the lemmas, longitudinally bowed-out by the caryopses, 2-keeled, keels usually ciliate, intercostal region membranous or hyaline; anthers 2-3; ovaries glabrous; styles free to the bases. Cleistogamous spikelets occasionally present, sometimes on the axillary panicles, sometimes on the terminal panicles. Caryopses variously shaped, x = 10. </description>
  <discussion>Eragrostis, a genus of approximately 350 species, grows in tropical and subtropical regions throughout the world. About 110 species are native or adventive in the Western Hemisphere; 25 species are native in the Flora region, 24 are introduced. In most taxa native to the Western Hemisphere, disarticulation is acropetal and the lemmas fall with the caryopses, leaving the paleas attached to the rachilla.
Nathaniel Wolf (1776), the person who first named Eragrostis, made no statement concerning the origin of its name. Clifford (1996) provides three possible derivations: from eros, 'love', and Agrostis, the Greek name for an indeterminate herb; from the Greek er, 'early' and agrostis, 'wild', referring to the fact that some species of Eragrostis are early invaders of arable land; or the Greek eri-, a prefix meaning 'very' or 'much', suggesting that the name means many-flowered Agrostis. Many authors have stated that the first portion of the name is derived from eros, but none has explained the connection between Eragrostis and passionate expressions of love, the kind of love to which eros applies.
