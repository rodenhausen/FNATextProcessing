Heterogamous spikelets: sessile spikelets 8-11.5 mm, dark brown, awned; calluses about 3 mm; awns 10-15 cm; pedicellate spikelets 16-21 mm, unawned; lower glumes scabrous or sparsely ciliate distally, midveins glandular, pitted. 2n = 20.</description>
  <discussion>Heteropogon melanocarpus is probably native to the Eastern Hemisphere, but is now found in tropical regions throughout the world. It grows in pine woods, fields, and disturbed areas of the southern United States. When fresh, plants of H. melanocarpus smell like citronella oil.</discussion>
