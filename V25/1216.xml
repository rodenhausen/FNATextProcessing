Culms 10-50 cm, erect to spreading or drooping, lower internodes very short, upper 2-4 internodes often much elongated; fall phase branching from the basal nodes, usually producing sterile shoots or condensed secondary panicles within about 5 cm of the ground. Cauline leaves 2-4; ligules 0.5-1 mm, of hairs; blades usually erect, stiff, upper blades 1-5 mm wide, 15-60 times as long. Primary panicles usually exserted. Spikelets narrowly ellipsoid to obovoid, usually pubescent, sometimes glabrous. Upper florets subacute to acute or umbonate.</description>
