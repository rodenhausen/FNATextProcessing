Inflorescence units usually only terminal; peduncles with 2-6(10) rames; rames 5-11 cm, exserted at maturity, usually purplish, sometimes yellowish; internodes sparsely to densely pubescent, hairs 2.2-4.2 mm, usually white, rarely yellowish. Sessile spikelets 5-11 mm, scabrous; awns 8-25 mm; anthers 3, 2.5-4.5 mm. Pedicellate spikelets 3.5-12 mm, usually well-developed and staminate. 2n = 20, 40, 60 (usually), 70, 80.</description>
  <discussion>Andropogon gerardii grows in prairies, meadows, and generally dry soils. It is a widespread species, extending from southern Canada to Mexico, and was once dominant over much of its range. It is frequently planted for erosion control, restoration, or as an ornamental; the records from Washington and central Montana reflect such plantings. It hybridizes with A. ballii, the two sometimes being treated as conspecific subspecies.</discussion>
