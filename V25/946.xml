  <description type="morphology">Plants sometimes weakly cespitose, but often with a single main culm branching 2-10 cm above the base, sparsely hairy. Culms 5-15(25) cm tall, 0.5-1 mm thick, often strictly erect, but sometimes decumbent when "top heavy" from profuse branching above. Leaves usually without a "collar" line; blades 1-3 cm long, 1.5-2 mm wide. Spikes 5-10 cm, more congested distally than basally; lower internodes 5-15 mm; upper internodes 2-7 mm. Spikelets with 5-20 florets. Glumes subequal or the lower glumes a little shorter than the upper, 3-6 mm, with 3-5 teeth to 1 mm; lemmas 4.5-6 mm, acute or awn-tipped teeth about equal and 1/2 as long as the lemma, spreading or slightly recurved; paleas slightly shorter than the lemmas; anthers about 3 mm. Caryopses about 3 mm, narrowly oblong; embryos nearly as long as the caryopses. 2n = 26.</description>
