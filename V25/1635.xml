  <discussion>A native of Malaysia, Themeda quadrivalvis has been found at scattered locations in the contiguous United States. Towne and Ballard (2002) reported that it is a common contaminant of the thistle seed sold for bird feeders. Most of the seeds are sterile, but a few are not. So far as is known, the species is not established in the Flora region.</discussion>
