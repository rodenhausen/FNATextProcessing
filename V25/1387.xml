  <description type="morphology">Plants annual or perennial; cespitose, rarely rhizomatous. Culms 10-600 cm, erect or decumbent. Ligules membranous and ciliate or of hairs; blades flat, folded, or involute, or plicate and petiolate (subg. Ptychopbyllum). Inflorescences terminal, panicles, usually dense and spikelike, occasionally loose and open; disarticulation usually below the glumes, spikelets falling intact, bristles persistent. Spikelets 1-5 mm, usually lanceoloid-ellipsoid, rarely globose, turgid, subsessile to short pedicellate, in fascicles on short branches or single on a short branch, some or all subtended by 1-several, terete bristles (sterile branchlets). Lower glumes membranous, not saccate, less than 1/2 as long as the spikelets, 1-7-veined; upper glumes membranous to herbaceous at maturity, 1/2 as long as to nearly equaling the upper lemmas in length, 3-9-veined; lower florets staminate or sterile; lower lemmas membranous, equaling or rarely exceeding the upper lemmas, rarely absent, not constricted or indurate basally, 5-7-veined; lower paleas usually hyaline to membranous at maturity, rarely absent or reduced, veins not keeled; upper florets bisexual; upper lemmas and paleas indurate, transversely rugose, rarely smooth; anthers 3, not penicillate; styles 2, free or fused basally, white or red. Caryopses small, ellipsoid to subglobose, compressed dorsiventrally. x = 9. </description>
  <discussion>Setaria, a genus of about 140 species, grows predominantly in tropical and warm-temperate regions, but it is particularly well-represented in Africa, Asia, and South America. Species from the Flora region fall into one of three categories: native to North America, native to South America, or native to the Eastern Hemisphere. There are 27 species in the Flora region; fifteen are native, nine are established introductions, one is cultivated, and two are not established or have been collected only at scattered locations. Several species of the native Setaria macrostachya complex (S. macrostacbya, S. leucopila, S. texana, S. villosissima, and S. scheelei) provide valuable forage in the southwestern United States. Setaria italica has been cultivated for centuries in Asia and Europe, providing food for humans and their livestock. The majority of species in temperate North America are aggressive, exotic annuals which collectively are a major nuisance, particularly in the corn and bean fields of the midwestern states.</discussion>
