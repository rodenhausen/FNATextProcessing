  <discussion>Once known from wet or moist sites in the southwestern deserts from southern California, Nevada, and Utah to western Texas, Imperata brevifolia is currently known only from populations in Grand Canyon National Park. It was last collected outside the park in the early 1970s at a site that is now under Lake Powell. Most collections were made before 1945, in sites that are now used for housing or agriculture.
Imperata brevifolia is listed as a noxious weed by the state of California. The reason for the listing is not clear; it may stem from confusion of this native species with one of the introduced weedy species.
