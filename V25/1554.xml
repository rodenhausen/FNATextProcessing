  <description type="morphology">Culms 60-150(200) cm tall, 2-4 mm thick, robust; nodes glabrous or shortly hirsute. Leaves cauline, evenly distributed, glabrous, dark green; ligules 2.5-3 mm; blades 12-20 cm long, (3)4-7 mm wide, flat to folded.

Sessile spikelets (3)3.5-4.5 mm, narrowly ovate to lanceÂ¬olate, shiny green, apices acute; lower glumes hirtellous on the lower 1/2, hairs shorter than 0.8 mm, lacking a dorsal pit; awns 9-14 mm; anthers 1-2 mm.

  <discussion>Bothriochloa longipaniculata grows at 2-200 m, along roadsides and in fields, open woodlands, disturbed ground, and swales of the Gulf coastal prairie, often in heavy clay soil. Its range extends from southern Texas and Louisiana to northeastern Mexico and possibly Panama.</discussion>
