  <discussion>Muhlenbergia arizonica grows in sandy drainages and gravelly canyons, and on plateaus and rocky slopes in open desert grasslands, at elevations of 1220-2230 m. Its range extends from the southwestern United States into northwestern Mexico. Flowering is from August to October.</discussion>
