Panicles 4-15 cm long, 1.5-4 cm wide, not dense; primary branches 0.5-5 cm, appressed or diverging up to 40Â° from the rachises; pedicels 0.5-6 mm, flattened, scabrous. Spikelets 2.8-3.5 mm. Glumes subequal, 0.6-1.8 mm, scabridulous distally, truncate to obtuse, unawned; lower glumes 1-veined; upper glumes 3-veined, 3-toothed, often erose; lemmas 2.8-3.5 mm, lanceolate, loosely pubescent on the basal 1/3 of the midveins and margins, hairs to 0.6 mm, apices scabridulous, acute, mucronate,   mucros shorter than 1 mm; paleas 2.8-3.5 mm, lanceolate, acute; anthers 1.4-2.3 mm, purple.
