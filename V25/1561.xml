  <discussion>Bothriochloa edwardsiana grows in the rocky plains and prairies of the Edwards Plateau of Texas, on calcareous soil, at 300-600 m. It also grows in northern Mexico and Uruguay. It resembles B. hybrida in some respects, but that species has a more robust habit, predominantly cauline foliage, and wider leaf blades.</discussion>
