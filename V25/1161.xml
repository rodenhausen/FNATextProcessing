    <name_authority_date>Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp. implicatum (Scribn.) Freckmann & Lelong </name_authority_date>
  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Plants densely cespitose. Culms seldom over 50 cm, slender, suberect, ascending or spreading; nodes more or less densely pubescent; fall phase branching extensively from the lower and midculm nodes, with conspicuous, flabellate fascicles of branches and reduced blades. Cauline sheaths shorter than the internodes, lower sheaths usually pilose with papillose-based hairs, upper sheaths often short-pubescent; midculm sheaths about 1/2 as long as the internodes; blades usually 2-6 mm wide, more than 8 times longer than wide, relatively firm, erect to ascending, often yellowish-green, abaxial surfaces densely pubescent with short papillose-based hairs or short-pubescent with subappressed hairs, adaxial surfaces more or less densely pilose, hairs to 6 mm, conspicuous, erect or ascending, occasionally with shorter hairs underneath. Spikelets 1.3-1.6 mm, usually broadly obovoid.</description>
  <discussion>Dichanthelium acuminatum subsp. implicatum usually grows in low, moist areas, including open woodÂ¬lands, meadows, bogs, and cedar and hemlock swamps, and also in drier, sandy areas. Its range extends from south central Canada to the midwestern and northeastern United States. It intergrades occasionally with the more widespread subsp. fasciculatum.</discussion>
