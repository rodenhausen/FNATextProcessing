Sheaths glabrous or sparsely pilose; ligules membranous, not or only shortly ciliate; blades to 15 cm long, about 4 mm    wide, scabrous. Panicles with 8-10 clearly separate branches, these usually  digitate, occasionally a poorly-developed second whorl present just below the terminal whorl; branches to 20 cm, divergent, basal 2-5 cm without spikelets, averaging 3-4 spikelets per cm elseÂ¬where. Spikelets with 1 bisexual and 1 sterile floret. Lower glumes 2.7-3 mm; upper glumes 3.5-3.8 mm; lowest lemmas 3.7-4.3 mm long, 0.7-0.8 mm wide, lanceolate to narrowly ovate, sides not conspicuously grooved, margins glabrous or sparsely appressed pubescent distally with hairs shorter than 1 mm, apices acute, awned, awns 7-11 mm; second florets 2-2.5 mm long, about 0.5 mm wide, narrowly elliptic, acute, inconspicuously bilobed, awns 4.5-6.5 mm.
