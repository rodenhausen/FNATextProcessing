  <common_names>BARESTEM PASPALUM</common_names>
  <description type="morphology">Plants erect. Leaves mostly basal; blades to 15 cm long, 3-10 mm wide, glabrous, usually recurved, yellow-green, margins ciliate. Panicle branches 2.4-9.2 cm long, ascending or nodding, arcuate; branch axes 0.2-0.6 mm wide. Spikelets 1.4-1.8 mm long, 0.9-1.3 mm wide, elliptic to obovate or suborbicular, glabrous or with scattered glandular hairs, not spotted; lower lemmas without an evident midvein; upper florets 1.4-1.8 mm.</description>
  <discussion>Paspalum setaceum var. longepedunculatum grows on open ground, usually in moist areas such as along ditches and roadsides, as well as in flatwoods. It is found primarily in the coastal plain of the southeastern United States, but has also been found in Ohio, Kentucky, and Tennessee. It is similar to var. villosissimum, differing in its glabrous leaves, more delicate habit, and more poorly-developed rhizomes. Both varieties grow in peninsular Florida, but var. longepedunculatum also grows along the coast as far west as the Mississippi delta and as far north as southern North Carolina.</discussion>
