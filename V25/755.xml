  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; loosely matted. Culms 5-45 cm, arising from the bases of old depressed culms, compressed-keeled, developing branches below the lower leaf nodes;  internodes mostly glabrous, sometimes minutely puberulent below the nodes. Sheaths longer than the intern¬odes, keeled, keels scabridulous, not becoming papery or spirally coiled when old; ligules 0.5-1.5 mm, membra¬nous, truncate to obtuse, erose, without lateral lobes; blades 1-15 cm long, 0.8-2 mm wide, flat to conduplicate, smooth or scabridulous abaxially, hirtellous adaxially, midveins thickened and whitish proximally. Panicles 2-20 cm long, (0.2)2.5-6 cm wide, diffuse; primary branches 0.4-6 cm long, about 0.1 mm thick, ascending, diverging 10-60° from the rachises, naked basally; pedicels 0.2-7 mm, glabrous. Spikelets 1.3-2.1 mm, dark purplish to plumbeous, occasionally with 2 florets. Glumes equal, 0.4-1.3 mm, glabrous, 1-veined, apices scabrous, acute to obtuse, sometimes erose or notched, unawned; lemmas 1.2-2 mm, oblong-elliptic, dark purplish to plumbeous, glabrous, faintly 3-veined, apices acute to obtuse, unawned; paleas 1.3-2.1 mm, oblong-elliptic, glabrous, acute to obtuse; anthers 0.6-0.9 mm, dark purple. Caryopses 0.6-0.8 mm, ovoid, brownish. 2n = 42.</description>
  <discussion>Muhlenbergia uniflora grows in bogs, wet meadows, and lake shores in sandy or peaty, often acidic, soils, at elevations of 0-650 m. It is native to eastern North America, but was collected once in British Columbia, probably having been introduced from ship ballast, and was recently collected from a commercial cranberry bog in Oregon. The collection from Texas may also be an introduction.</discussion>
