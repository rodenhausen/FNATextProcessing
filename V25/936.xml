Panicles 10-20(30) cm long, to 3 cm wide at the base, loosely contracted to somewhat open. Spikelets 3.2-6.8 mm. Lower glumes 2.8-5.1 mm; upper glumes 3.2-6.8 mm, 3-veined; lowest lemmas 1.5-2 mm; awns 2.5-5 mm, usually exceeding the glumes; anthers 1-1.8 mm. 2n = 40.</description>
  <discussion>Enneapogon cenchroides has been introduced and is persisting in the Ajo, Santa Catalina, Tucson, and Galiuro mountains of southern Arizona. Outside the Americas, its range extends from Sudan southward to the Cape Provinces of South Africa, through Arabia to India, and on Ascension Island.</discussion>
