  <description type="morphology">Plants perennial; rarely annual. Culms herbaceous. Ligules of hairs; blade epidermes with bicellular microhairs. Inflorescences terminal, dense, narrow to somewhat open panicles; disarticulation above the glumes but not between the florets (except in Cottea). Spikelets with 3-10 florets, sometimes only the lowest floret bisexual. Lemmas 5-13-veined, veins extending into awns, often with intermixed hyaline lobes. Caryopses with punctate hila; embryos 1/2 or more as long as the caryopses. x = 10.</description>
  <discussion>The tribe Pappophoreae includes five genera and approximately 40 species. It is represented in tropical and warm regions around the world.</discussion>
