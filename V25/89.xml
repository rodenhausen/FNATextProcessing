Lower glumes 1-2.6 mm, narrowly triangular to ovate; upper glumes 1.8-2.8 mm, obovate to widely obovate; lemmas 2-3.6 mm, light brown, dark green, or lead-colored, usually without a basal dark spot, apices usually truncate or obtuse, rarely broadly acute, sometimes bifid, sometimes mucronate; anthers 3, 0.2-0.6(1) mm.

  <discussion>Leptochloa fusca subsp. uninervia is native from the southern United States to Argentina. It may be confused with L. scabra, from which it usually differs in its truncate or obtuse lemmas.</discussion>
