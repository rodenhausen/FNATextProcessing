Leaves mostly basal; sheaths glabrous; ligules 0.2-0.5 mm, membranous, ciliolate; blades 2-30 cm long, 2-3(9) mm wide, mostly glabrous or puberulous adaxially, bases sometimes with hispid hairs. Panicles 4-8(16) cm long, 1.5-3 cm wide, ovate, with many branches; branches 3-7 cm, sharply ascending, capillary, naked basal portions 2-6 cm, puberulous, terminating in a rame; rames with a triplet of spikelets.

  <discussion>Chrysopogon fulvus is native from southern India to Thailand, where it is considered a good forage grass. It was grown at the experiment station in Gainesville, Florida, and subsequently found in adjacent flatwoods as an escape.</discussion>
