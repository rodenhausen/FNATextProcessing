  </taxon_identification>
  <description type="morphology">Culms less than 100 cm, usually slender, greatly compressed. Leaves mostly basal; sheaths narrower than those of subspp. elongatum and rigudulum, compressed, often pubescent, at least along the sides near the summit or at the throat; ligules 0.5-3 mm, membranous, usually fimbriate-ciliate; blades usually 2-7 mm wide, often folded or involute, usually pilose adaxially, at least near the base, bases about equal in width to the subtending sheaths. Panicles mostly terminal. Spikelets 2-2.7 mm, green or slightly purplish, set obliquely on the pedicels. Lower glumes about 1/2 as long as the spikelets; upper glumes slightly longer than the lower lemmas, acute; lower lemmas acute, the apices diverging slightly from those of the upper glumes.</description>
  <discussion>Panicum rigidulum subsp. pubescens grows primarily in moist pine savannahs, bogs, and other similar open, sandy habitats on the Atlantic and Gulf coastal plains of the United States.</discussion>
