Culms 50-150 cm; fall phase branching from the mid- and upper culm nodes, branches rebranching, often forming dense axillary fascicles, secondary panicles enclosed in the sheaths. Cauline leaves 5-14; sheaths usually widest near midlength, narrowed to the summit, strongly papillose-hispid or softly pubescent and viscid, summits often mottled with white to yellowish blotches; ligules membranous or of hairs. Primary panicles exserted. Spikelets 2.2-3.6 mm, ellipsoid to ovoid, with prominent veins, pointed. Upper florets acute to acuminate, sometimes umbonate or apiculate, apices often with a minute tuft of hairs.</description>
