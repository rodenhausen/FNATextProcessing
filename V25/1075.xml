Panicles with 6-8 spikelike primary branches on 4-6 cm rachises; primary branches 8-13 cm, axes triquetrous, narrowly winged, wings less than 1/2 as wide as the midribs, lower and middle portions of the branches bearing spikelets in appressed, unequally pedicellate pairs; secondary branches rarely present; axillary inflorescences not present; pedicels not adnate to the branch axes. Spikelets about 3 mm, elliptic lanceolate, acute.
