  <discussion>Variety stenophylla ranges from central Texas to southeastern South Dakota in a half dozen disjunct areas; it is most common in western Oklahoma and adjacent Kansas and Texas. The variety is known from one or two border counties in northeastern Colorado, northwestern Iowa, eastern New Mexico, and southeastern South Dakota. It is sparsely to moderately hispido-strigose and moderately stipitate-glandular. The presence of large, broad-based hairs along the margins of the distal leaves and peduncle bracts also contribute to the general appearance of the plant. The number of hairs and glands varies greatly and only the hairiest leaves take on a somewhat grayish green color; usually the leaves are bright green. The proximal stems are often brown, usually rather brittle, and naked, the leaves having fallen before flowering.</discussion>
